I am extremely delighted for my prayer made during my baptism in 2018 has been heard - that I have continuously grow in my faith.\nServing in the Cantonese Youth Fellowship Cantonese Youth Fellowship (CYF) is a fellowship in the Chinese Churches in London (CCiL), and has been nurturing many leaders that would later serve CCiL. It has been my priviledge to stay in CYF for four years, and to serve in the CYF committee for my second time. In particular, I have been extremely touched by reading members testimonies from the Break-me-through camp and baptism of some of the members, as God has demonstrated his power through the life-changing stories.\nWorking as a vice-chair has been challenging, and I am delighted to collaborate with the chair (Justin Leung), the vice-chair de-facto (Vera Shek) and other committee members in delivering the programmes for the CYF. Our vision during my tenure is to encourage members to “learn and act like Jesus” (學像耶穌, 活像耶穌) in line with the CCiL’s general vision.\nContents and contribution In term 1 we started off with explaining the ways to know Jesus more and building relationships with Him, including praying, devotion and reading Bible, followed by an invitation to submit ourselves to God. We have focused in term 2 by reflecting our sin, before discussing how to be a disciple and live up God’s teaching through our worship, fellowship and evangelism. The final term consists of assorted programmes that encourage members to respond to issues in our daily lives, such as how to develop a God-centered boy-girl relationships and supporting refugees from around the world. The year ends with a break-through camp that encourages members to reflect on the past and prepare for the breakthroughs that could make them a better christian in the future. Overall, it has been encouraging to see how members enjoy CYF as a family of believers that share a common core-value. I am also delighted to see some members who decided to declare their faith in public through baptism, and/or commiting themselves to further service (e.g. committees, mission trips).\nThere is not a clear job description for the role as a vice chair. The main role of being a vice chair is to support the committee (especially chair and devotional supports) by continuously monitoring the needs in fellowship, as well as to help out with duties that has not been taken up by other committees otherwise. Perhaps the most challenging duty would be to carry out interviews for members and prospective committees. The former is to access the current faiths and needs for the newly-joined participants, and the latter is to access the preparedness for a member to serve in the CYF committee. I am also delighted to re-launch the Sunday prayer breakfast before the sermon, as well as leading a few bible studies during a CYF programme / Sunday bible study. All these achievements would not have been possible without the blessings from God and prayers from different communities.\nPersonal Reflections With great power comes with great responsibility. This has been a motto that was kept in my mind, and I would like to be perfect in every aspects of my service. However, I learnt from experience that this is not practical. There are many things that I would like to have done better, and I would like to list a few here.\nHumbleness Firstly, I would like to be more humble. As one of the most experienced members in CYF, I believe that there is one particular mode of collaboration that the committee should stick with. This had created unnecessary restrictions on the mode of working, and in particular limited our creativity in coming up with activities that better address the needs of the members. (Unfortunately I wasn’t aware of that until the members’ interview.) I sometimes find it struggling to accept others’ opinion when they have come up with a better idea. The success of the next committee has urged me to rethink on how I should collaborate with others, and as it turns out, I should be more open-minded.\nRelationship with committee members Humbleness has been a great issue with my service, but there is a prominent problem. It seems like I have prioritise the wrong thing during my service. I have always been expecting my relationships with other committee members to flourish, owing to the usual advice given by previous committee members that “CYF committee should always be another fellowship”. It is certainly right that committees should support each other like how other ordinary members do, but that does not mean that I should be a very good friend to all the committee members. It seems that I have put an unreasonably high expectation on my relationships with other committee members, to the point that I am no longer making God as my priority to my service. This is, perhaps, due to my feeling of insecurity that emerged during the Covid period. This had led to un-necessary disappointment and bitterness that seems to have also affected relationships of others.\nThere hasn’t been a breakthrough until when I came across a sermon delivered by Prof. Bao in last August on the parable of Lazarus and a rich man. God had pointed out that there was a chasm between the rich man and Him, as the rich man did not treat Lazarus well. To this end Jesus was trying to address the issue of the Jews (especially the Pharisees) rejecting the gentiles. Prof. Bao then made an important warning on this ground that we should proactively address any cracks in our relationships with other people. I have therefore prayed further to overcome my bitterness with other committee members.\nFortunately, I have now learned through discussions with other friends that seeking a deep relationship to particular members should never be the priority of my service, for the obvious reason that we are indeed serving God but not ourselves. In addition, God has been provided many good spiritual partners that have sustained my journey at Imperial, for which I should be thankful for. I am glad that I find it easier to get along with CYF members in general as I set a reasonable expectation with members of CYF in general. This has been a valuable lesson I had during my service in CYF, and I am thankful for those who has supported my journey.\nDiversity of serving This is an interesting issue that has come up in my mind when there is once again an invitation for new participants to serve in CYF. The current available positions are unsurprisingly from the worship team (band), cooking team and the Audio-visual (AV) team. I really appreciate the structured invitation, but I think we should diversify the opportunities available to members even more, so that members who are talented in other aspects wouldn’t be left out, and that we could provide sufficient trainings for those interested in serving as a leading/pastoral role.\nAbility to address the complex needs of members To be completed\nTime management Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom. (Psalm 90:12)\nReturning to basics - be thou my vision There are many times when one feel burnt out and tired of serving because of the chores associated with our duties. The best way to be powered-up again is to remember our visions of serving. Some examples I have heard from the interviews include: - to respond to God’s love and care through CYF. - to improve different aspects to CYF, e.g. quality of relationships among CYF members, quality of programme… - to utilise the spiritual gifts from God, e.g. ability to understand others’ feeling, understanding of bible, ability to share experiences, musicianship…\nI am personally encouraged when hearing the motivation of service, and I hope that you will remember the above responses whenever you feel discouraged in your service.\nVision for programmes (and development) Vision gives you a general direction of planning programme and growth of CYF as a fellowship. Vision ensures the programmes are actually telling a coherent story. This would enable us to follow-up easily with participants, so that they would be constantly reminded of the programme contents and help them to apply what they have learnt in daily life.\nThinking of vision Although I am a keen advocate of planning programmes by vision, I often find it very hard to think of one. Perhaps my advice is impractical for some of the people, as suggested by this song. (Remark: this song forms part of Vera’s sharing on Instagram). I recognise there is no way out except to humble before God, praying that God would lead us the way.\nHere I point out some potential themes, based on observations in the committee last year. Hope these are helpful.\nFundamental issues in christianity: putting emphasis on experiencing sin, salvation and relationship with God. This is a follow up for those joining BMT, and at the same time an opportunity for newcomers to reflect on their faith. Act as disciples in school and in workplace. This would help participants to actually live out God’s teaching in daily life. Moreover, being the “salt and light” in our communities helps others to see God’s work and encourage them to explore the Gospel. Evangelism: this is part of the aim of CYF. I remembered of CYF sharing the principles of evangelism before the freshers’ events and at the middle of spring term. It would be useful to share some practical tips of evangelism, as well as provide opportunities for participants to put the theories into practice. Respond to social issues in christian way. That includes wars, injustice, and yes you guessed it, marriage and LGBT.

I really appreciate the structured invitation, but I think we should diversify the opportunities available to members even more, so that members who are talented in other aspects wouldn&rsquo;t be left out, and that we could provide sufficient trainings for those interested in serving as a leading/pastoral role.</p><h1 id=ability-to-address-the-complex-needs-of-members>Ability to address the complex needs of members<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#ability-to-address-the-complex-needs-of-members>#</a></h1><blockquote><p>To be completed</p></blockquote><h1 id=time-management>Time management<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#time-management>#</a></h1><blockquote><p>Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom.

The best way to be powered-up again is to <strong>remember our visions of serving</strong>. Some examples I have heard from the interviews include:
- to respond to God&rsquo;s love and care through CYF.
- to improve different aspects to CYF, e.g. quality of relationships among CYF members, quality of programme&mldr;
- to utilise the spiritual gifts from God, e.g. ability to understand others&rsquo; feeling, understanding of bible, ability to share experiences, musicianship&mldr;</p><p>I am personally encouraged when hearing the motivation of service, and I hope that you will remember the above responses whenever you feel discouraged in your service.</p><h3 id=vision-for-programmes-and-development>Vision for programmes (and development)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#vision-for-programmes-and-development>#</a></h3><p>Vision gives you a general direction of planning programme and growth of CYF as a fellowship. Vision ensures the programmes are actually telling a coherent story. This would enable us to <strong>follow-up</strong> easily with participants, so that they would be constantly reminded of the programme contents and help them to apply what they have learnt in daily life.</p><h3 id=thinking-of-vision>Thinking of vision<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#thinking-of-vision>#</a></h3><p>Although I am a keen advocate of planning programmes by vision, I often find it very hard to think of one. Perhaps my advice is impractical for some of the people, as suggested by <a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/CVNVv-7oU8e/>this song</a>. (Remark: this song forms part of Vera&rsquo;s sharing on Instagram). I recognise there is no way out except to humble before God, praying that God would lead us the way.</p><p>Here I point out some potential themes, based on observations in the committee last year. Hope these are helpful.</p><ul><li>Fundamental issues in christianity: putting emphasis on <em>experiencing</em> sin, salvation and relationship with God. This is a follow up for those joining BMT, and at the same time an opportunity for newcomers to reflect on their faith.</li><li>Act as disciples in school and in workplace. This would help participants to actually live out God&rsquo;s teaching in daily life. Moreover, being the &ldquo;salt and light&rdquo; in our communities helps others to see God&rsquo;s work and encourage them to explore the Gospel.</li><li>Evangelism: this is part of the aim of CYF. I remembered of CYF sharing the principles of evangelism before the freshers&rsquo; events and at the middle of spring term. It would be useful to share some practical tips of evangelism, as well as provide opportunities for participants to put the theories into practice.</li><li>Respond to social issues in christian way. That includes wars, injustice, and yes you guessed it, marriage and LGBT.</li></ul><h1 id=external-links>External Links<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#external-links>#</a></h1><ul><li><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19NCe_Z2RZ2sLjtIeMUMIxnJQO_eBh0Iq?usp=sharing">Handover Folder</a></li></ul><h3 id=general-reflection>General reflection<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#general-reflection>#</a></h3><ul><li>Collaboration is more about teamwork not individual work</li><li>Demonstrating God&rsquo;s power through weaknesses</li><li>Proactivity</li></ul></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://samuel-chlam.github.io/masterplan-2022/tags/discussion/>discussion</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://samuel-chlam.github.io/masterplan-2022/posts/basic_christianity/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Basic Christianity</span></a>
