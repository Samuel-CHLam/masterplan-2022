I would like to firstly thank all communities who have been continuously praying for my continuous development as a christian. I am extremely delighted for my prayer made during my baptism in 2018 has been heard - that I have continuously grow in my faith.\nPersonal Reflections With great power comes with great responsibility. This has been a motto that was kept in my mind, and I would like to be perfect in every aspects of my service. However, I learnt from experience that this is not practical. There are many things that I would like to have done better, and I would like to list a few here.\nHumbleness Firstly, I would like to be more humble. As one of the most experienced members in CYF, I believe that there is one particular mode of collaboration that the committee should stick with. This had created unnecessary restrictions on the mode of working, and in particular limited our creativity in coming up with activities that better address the needs of the members. (Unfortunately I wasn’t aware of that until the members’ interview.) I sometimes find it struggling to accept others’ opinion when they have come up with a better idea. The success of the next committee has urged me to rethink on how I should collaborate with others, and as it turns out, I should be more open-minded.\nRelationship with committee members Humbleness has been a great issue with my service, but there is an even more prominent problem. It seems like I have prioritise the wrong thing during my service. I have always been expecting my relationships with other committee members to flourish, owing to the usual advice given by previous committee members that “CYF committee should always be another fellowship”. It is certainly right that committees should support each other like how other ordinary members do, but that does not mean that I should be a very good friend to all the committee members. It seems that I have put an unreasonably high expectation on my relationships with other committee members, to the point that I am no longer making God as my priority to my service. This is, perhaps, due to my feeling of insecurity that emerged during the Covid period. This had led to un-necessary disappointment and bitterness that seems to have also affected relationships of others.\nThere hasn’t been a breakthrough until when I came across a sermon delivered by Prof. Bao in last August on the parable of Lazarus and a rich man. God had pointed out that there was a chasm between the rich man and Him, as the rich man did not treat Lazarus well. To this end Jesus was trying to address the issue of the Jews (especially the Pharisees) rejecting the gentiles. Prof. Bao then made an important warning on this ground that we should proactively address any cracks in our relationships with other people. I have therefore prayed further to overcome my bitterness with other committee members.\n…And besides all this, between us (the Lord et. al.) and you (the rich man) a great chasm has been set in place, so that those who want to go from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us.’ (Luke 16:26)\nFortunately, I have now learned through discussions with other friends that seeking a deep relationship to particular members should never be the priority of my service, for the obvious reason that we are indeed serving God but not ourselves. In addition, God has been provided many good spiritual partners that have sustained my journey at Imperial, for which I should be thankful for. I am glad that I find it easier to get along with CYF members in general as I set a reasonable expectation with members of CYF in general. This has been a valuable lesson I had during my service in CYF, and I am thankful for those who has supported my journey.\nLove and care of CYF - addressing complex needs of members I am delighted to see how members perceive CYF as a loving and caring community in general, which is a good first step for CYF to fulfill its pastoral duty as part of supporting members in their lives as a christian. However, I am also aware of the increasing challenge for CYF to fulfill pastoral duties as we welcome more members from a diverse background, and so some of our members may not feel as welcomed as they would have expected. I feel extremely sorry to say that CYF has its capacity in handling different kind of needs for members, and sometimes they could not be adressed in full, or even be ignored. On this issue I could not offer any advice, but to seek external help if needed. For instance, I have seeked independent advice about CYF from from the parties:\nGod, of course! In addition, church prayer ministry members, church bible study group members, chaplain from my college, my parents, and other Christian friends (e.g. from my high school, or Christian Union). Of course, I would make sure that some level of confidentiality is maintained, e.g. the name of relevant parties are usually not disclosed (with exceptions e.g. church prayer ministry members), and that some sensitive details are censored. That being said, I would recommend CYF to continue promote pray for any issues faced, especially the more complex ones. Some forms of training for pastoral care (also see below), so that we have further capacity to make preliminary contributions to the challenges before referring to external resources. To the end, the ability of offering emotional supports is essential in daily lives - it could also be a good strategy to evangelise as well.\nConclusion For the reasons above, I must admit that my service at CYF was far from perfect. There were often times when I feel frustrated because of the chores associated with our duties. It has been an encouragement, however, to see how God turns our time and efforts into miracles. To the end, Paul said that\nBut he (the Lord) said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ’s power may rest on me. (2 Corinthians 12:8)\nI am delighted to see how this teaching is demonstrated through different sharings from the members, and therefore I am thankful to God for his wonder.\nFurther handover notes Diversity of serving This is an interesting reflection that has come up in my mind during ongoing discussions with members on opportunities to serve in the fellowship. Serving is a response to God’s love, and forms an integral part of the lives in fellowship, and we have a diversified portfolio with the positions available to members, namely\nworship team* cooking team* audio-visual (AV) team (AV)* leading game sessions** sharings before main programmes** social media team contributing to group socials leading in Sunday bible study (TBC) *currently recruiting members\n**traditionally the committee would invite members individually\nI appreciate the current diversity of the roles available for members to serve, but I believe we could go further. At the end of the day, christian fellowship is a community for members to support each other in their growth as a christian. To achieve this main objective, more opportunities for serving/trainings should be available in the field of teaching and/or pastoral support. For instance,\ngroup leaders could invite interested members to lead discussions after the main programme committee members could host focus groups (i.e. more dinners!!) from time to time for members to provide informal feedback on the delivered programmes (this could be different from group socials as socials are more informal) prayer group: interested members could help keeping track on specific prayer requests by members coordinators for bible study / Alpha programme could invite interested members to the relevant trainings With the exception for the last item, the above serving roles do not require too much technical skills (in music/cooking/arts etc.), so general members could get involved into these roles easily (and do not feel left out). In addition, the above roles are, perhaps, more relevant to the main goals of the fellowship, and would serve as a good preparation for serving as a committee member.\nRemark It is also very important for members who are interested in serving (at specific roles) to make their preferences clear to the committee, and that members are encouraged to be open-minded with how they could get involved in CYF in general. I am especially fortunate to serve in church worship team as I approached individual worship leaders. The constitution of CYF has also pointed out that CYF should encourage members to get involved in other seriving roles in CCiL. Finally, it is always important to remember why we are serving God, see above. Working practice and time management Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom. (Psalm 90:12)\nI believe the next committee has done a marvellous job in planning ahead of time. All committee members have opportunities to contribute to the planning of programmes, which speed up the brainstorming process. It is also a good practice to prepare agenda before the actual meeting to allow time for committee members to response. Finally, more people could get involved in thinking about the programme content if appropriate (see above).\nCommittee should be aware of the extra time needed for interviews for new members and prospective new committees. It takes around 30-45 minutes for each interview, so it might be appropriate to start the members’ interviews in February. Current committees and advisors should also reserve a week in late May to conduct interviews for prospective committees - it could potentially take \u003e10 hours to complete all interviews.\nPlease also refer to the interview guidance here.\nExternal Links Handover Folder ","wordCount":"1691","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-01-03T02:30:00+08:00","dateModified":"2023-01-03T02:30:00+08:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Samuel Lam"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://samuel-chlam.github.io/news/posts/reflection_on_cyf_2022/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Samuel Lam's Blogs","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://samuel-chlam.github.io/news/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://samuel-chlam.github.io/news/ accesskey=h title="Blog of Samuel Lam (Alt + H)">Blog of Samuel Lam</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button><ul class=lang-switch><li>|</li></ul></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://samuel-chlam.github.io/news/lifestyle/ title=lifestyle><span>lifestyle</span></a></li><li><a href=https://samuel-chlam.github.io/news/academic/ title=academic><span>academic</span></a></li><li><a href=https://samuel-chlam.github.io/news/academic-outreach/ title=outreach><span>outreach</span></a></li><li><a href=https://samuel-chlam.github.io/news/christianity/ title=christianity><span>christianity</span></a></li><li><a href=https://samuel-chlam.github.io/news/branding/ title="personal branding"><span>personal branding</span></a></li><li><a href=https://samuel-chlam.github.io/news/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://samuel-chlam.github.io/news/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://samuel-chlam.github.io/news/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Review 2022 -

For instance,</p><ul><li>group leaders could invite interested members to lead discussions after the main programme</li><li>committee members could host focus groups (i.e. more dinners!!) from time to time for members to provide informal feedback on the delivered programmes (this could be different from group socials as socials are more informal)</li><li>prayer group: interested members could help keeping track on specific prayer requests by members</li><li>coordinators for bible study / Alpha programme could invite interested members to the relevant trainings</li></ul><p>With the exception for the last item, the above serving roles do not require too much technical skills (in music/cooking/arts etc.), so general members could get involved into these roles easily (and do not feel left out). In addition, the above roles are, perhaps, more relevant to the main goals of the fellowship, and would serve as a good preparation for serving as a committee member.</p><h3 id=remark>Remark<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#remark>#</a></h3><ul><li>It is also very important for members who are interested in serving (at specific roles) to make their preferences clear to the committee, and that members are encouraged to be open-minded with how they could get involved in CYF in general. I am especially fortunate to serve in church worship team as I approached individual worship leaders.</li><li>The constitution of CYF has also pointed out that CYF should encourage members to get involved in other seriving roles in CCiL.</li><li>Finally, it is always important to remember why we are serving God, see above.</li></ul><h2 id=working-practice-and-time-management>Working practice and time management<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#working-practice-and-time-management>#</a></h2><blockquote><p>Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom. (Psalm 90:12)</p></blockquote><p>I believe the next committee has done a marvellous job in planning ahead of time. All committee members have opportunities to contribute to the planning of programmes, which speed up the brainstorming process. It is also a good practice to prepare agenda before the actual meeting to allow time for committee members to response. Finally, more people could get involved in thinking about the programme content if appropriate (see above).</p><p>Committee should be aware of the extra time needed for interviews for new members and prospective new committees. It takes around 30-45 minutes for each interview, so it might be appropriate to start the members&rsquo; interviews in February. Current committees and advisors should also reserve a week in late May to conduct interviews for prospective committees - it could potentially take >10 hours to complete all interviews.</p><p>Please also refer to the interview guidance <a href=https://samuel-chlam.github.io/masterplan-2022/posts/clarification_of_cyf_interview_2022/>here</a>.</p><h1 id=external-links>External Links<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#external-links>#</a></h1><ul><li><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19NCe_Z2RZ2sLjtIeMUMIxnJQO_eBh0Iq?usp=sharing">Handover Folder</a></li></ul></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://samuel-chlam.github.io/news/tags/discussion/>Discussion</a></li><li><a href=https://samuel-chlam.github.io/news/tags/review/>Review</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://samuel-chlam.github.io/news/posts/christianity_review_2022/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Review 2022 - Christianity</span>
