      <description>Today we will go over Acts 15, verses 1-35. This passage is about the council at Jerusalem debating issue regarding circumcision. A quick plan would be
introduction (10 minutes): warm-up, key questions the debate of circumcision (5+15 minutes): carefully scrutinise the debates in the Jerusalem council tips of handling conflicts (20 minutes): study again the passage and look at how the churches and leaders deal with conflicts applications (20 minutes) wrapping up (10 minutes) Introduction Warm-up question: Do you think churches would compromise in debates regarding theological matters?</description>

      <description>We will be reading Matthew 19:16-30, the story of a rich man. If you have time, you may wish to continue reading the parable of the workers in the vineyard in Matthew 20:16, but this will only be covered briefly.
Questions By only just verse 26, can you infer what the verse is about? In verse 17 Jesus said &amp;ldquo;there is only One who is good&amp;rdquo;. Who was the One? Was it the rich man?</description>

      <description>Follow up of lectures Formalisation of Riemann (Darboux) Integral: the upper and lower Darboux sum is defined as $$U(f) = \inf_\mathcal{P} U(f,\mathcal{P}), \quad L(f) = \sup_\mathcal{P} L(f,\mathcal{P})$$ where
$$U(f,\mathcal{P} = (x_i)_{i=0}^n) = \sum _{i=0}^{n-1} \left( \sup _{x \in [x_i, x _{i+1})} f(x) \right) (x _{i+1} - x_i)$$
$$L(f,\mathcal{P} = (x_i)_{i=0}^n) = \sum _{i=0}^{n-1} \left( \inf _{x \in [x_i, x _{i+1})} f(x) \right) (x _{i+1} - x_i)$$

      <description>There are mainly two ways I am involved in outreaching as a christian - fellowship (Cantonese Youth Fellowship CYF) and Imperial College Christian Union (ICCU). However due to workload I will be gradually reducing my engagement in ICCU.
Cantonese Youth Fellowship As the vice-president of the CYF committee, I am responsible for facilitating President work and coordinating among other committees and participants. During the first term, I organised the freshers&amp;rsquo; events and provided pastoral supports to the participants.</description>

      <description>The following contents are taken from a discussion with my mother on 6/1/2022 (Thursday).
Basic Principles Reflect on the expected achievements of plans everyday as a way to keep us going Start brainstorming with big direction, then set up easy (small) targets following the direction. It is easy to get lost: think about the example of Peter walking on the sea, and how Jesus responded when Peter hesitated. (Matthew 14:22-33, Bible) Successful planning involves lots of research and discussions Mind your language Be flexible, &amp;ldquo;be water my friend&amp;rdquo; (Bruce Lee) Basic elements of a plan knowledge skill habit (usually 21 days or 49 days) attitude How to seek advice?</description>
