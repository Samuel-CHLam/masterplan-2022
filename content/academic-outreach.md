Promotion of mathematics is divided into three main programmes: Integrated study group and MathWiki, MathSoc engagement and general outreach

# MathWiki 

## August
- Research on network analysis between pages

## Continuous development
- Roadmap: something like [MIT Official Roadmap](https://math.mit.edu/academics/undergrad/roadmaps.php)
- Encourage allowing access to overview pages of each course.
- **MathSoc** to collect examples of M1R and M2R. 
- **MathSoc** to liaise with more faculties.
- Technical development: incorporating LaTeX editors. 
- Can we include the cost of buying domain + running server into annual budget? It costs ~200 pounds to have an AWS server. 
- Liaise with faculties

- Updating “events” page 
- Update on "governance" page (resignation of Salvi).
