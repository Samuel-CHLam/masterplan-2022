Promotion of mathematics is divided into three main programmes: Integrated study group and MathWiki, MathSoc engagement and general outreach

# Integrated study group and MathWiki

## Forming study group
- ACTION: Elect as class representative of two courses I am taking, inviting people to contribute in MathWiki.
- ACTION: Deciding regular time of going over problem sheets / coursework

## MathWiki
Bear in mind this is not the priority for personal development.

### Intermediate development: 
- By week 4: 
    - **20/1 Meeting between Amir and Thomas.**
    - recruit people to migrate of first- and second-year summaries, 
    - migrate all PDF notes to the AWS server. 
- **MathSoc** to ask if we can include official notes available on Blackboard but not on the MathWiki:  
    - Classical Dynamics 
    - Computational Linear Algebra, Finite Element Analysis, Principle of programming 
    - Graph Theory 
    - Riemannian Geometry 
- NEED MORE PROMOTION 
    - First email of the term
    - Year group chat
    - First week overview lectures
    - Academic/Wellbeing representatives
    - Invitation for advice
    - Invitation for feedback

### Future Development 

- Roadmap: something like [MIT Official Roadmap](https://math.mit.edu/academics/undergrad/roadmaps.php)
- Encourage allowing access to overview pages of each course.
- **MathSoc** to collect examples of M1R and M2R. 
- **MathSoc** to liaise with more faculties.
- Technical development: incorporating LaTeX editors. 
- Can we include the cost of buying domain + running server into annual budget? It costs ~200 pounds to have an AWS server. 
- Liaise with faculties 

# MathSoc 

## Website Update 

### By week 5 
- Replacement of resource page. 
- Include sponsorship details
- Updating “advice for teaching” page 
- Updating “events” page 
- Update on "governance" page (resignation of Salvi).
- WIM: do they want a webpage under MathSoc, or will they handle it by themselves? If so, how do they notify us with their updates? 
- UG Colloquium: do they still want a webpage? 
- PLEASE ASK PEOPLE TO FILL IN THE FEEDBACK SURVEY. 

### Further Development
- Integration with Google Analytics 
- Potential migration to department server etc. (Ideally should be hosted under union server but I have no idea how.) 
- Discord
- Handover

# Optimisation
- Translation of lecture materials to MathWiki: in summary format.
- Collaborate with TA to produce Python code demonstrations

# General Outreach
- When details are confirmed, ask if Javier would like to join me in sharing MIT experiences.
- Preparation for UG Colloqium in February (week 6) - e.g. 
    - Bayesian analysis and conjugate gradient descent or 
    - Brownian motion and empirical measure theory
- Invitation for trial viva voce.
