There are mainly two ways I am involved in outreaching as a christian - fellowship (Cantonese Youth Fellowship CYF) and Imperial College Christian Union (ICCU). However due to workload I will be gradually reducing my engagement in ICCU.

# Cantonese Youth Fellowship
As the vice-president of the CYF committee, I am responsible for facilitating President work and coordinating among other committees and participants. During the first term, I organised the freshers' events and provided pastoral supports to the participants.

## Committee
- Justin (President): Design programme, liaise with advisors for programmes and administrative issues, coordinate Sunday bible study and badminton.
- Vera (Vice-President *de-facto*, worship and music): give advice to programmes, design P&P, assign worship duties to members.
- Samuel (Vice-President): give advice to programmes, outreach to participants, administratives, early preparations for BMT.
- Cherry (pastoral): early bible studies with committee members, keep track of status of committees. Assign sharing duties.
- Thomas (secretary): Emails, administrative
- Chung (evangelism and outreach): assigning game duties, coordinate Sunday EBS.
- Amy, Prudence, Yanni (group leaders*): keep track of status of committees, lead discussions.

## Report

### Things to appreciate
- Despite the initial conflict in the committee, the preparation of programmes was generally well done. 
    - The Freshers' Camp (FC) was well-received, and participants generally felt welcomed.
    - Committee is finishing planning of all events. Appreciate how committees explain about the decisions during the planning process.
- Glad to see other experienced non-committee members are getting involved in different parts of CYF operations.

### Things to improve
- ~~The initial conflict weakened my bondings with other committee members, and as a result, I was not focusing on my duty.~~ (Relationship with committee members are generally improved.)
- I dominated in too many discussions in committee and groups: effective listening is needed.
- There are too many seniors in the committee - events like Praise and Prayer were planned in a rush due to huge academic workload. We should get more people involved.
- How can we get more people involved and **ensuring them have good spiritual lives?** 

## Working principles

### Communication: Be aware if I have spoken too much in regular meetings: 
- always end with "what do you think?"
- ask questions that are generally accessible to others;
- actively listen to other feedback and wait till they finish to respond;
- ask people if I have spoken too much;
- do not worry about dead air - other people will take care of it.
- Go beyond being silent and try to respond to others sharing. They need your encouragement.
- Enjoy the discussion with an aim to complete the main objective of discussion. 
- Don't force, we can always find another time to do.

### Bonding with committee members:
- Give thanks to the current good relationships. In particular, appreciate how committees respond and explain decisions. Continue pray that the good relationship can be maintained.
- start with something simple, e.g. chat, meal, or exercise together;
- ~~do not worry if I am "not close enough" with committee members:  the less worried I am, the better our relationship I could have.~~

### Bonding with general members:
- PRAY;
- try to prioritise quality than quantity in terms of building relationships with members;
- ACTION DONE: divide among group leaders, committee members and experienced members in providing pastoral and spiritual supports for group members. Regular review of members status during regular meetings.
- ACTION: Set up a spreadsheet detailing who need further attention.
- Remember it is appropriate to listen without getting involved in an unfamiliar discussion.

### Preparation of programmes: 
- ~~consult Justin before committee meetings if I have any ideas -- in fact, I should do this with other committee members as well;~~
- listen to committees, including their suggestions and feedback.

### BMT
- Invite involvement of senior members.
- Setup trello to track progresses.

### Serving in CYF
- I should gradually retire from my role as a CYF musician to provide more training opportunities for others.
- regular review Vincent/Michael how to be a good mentor of musicians/potential committee members
- ~~ACTION: ask musicians how they can be more involved in music (e.g. how should training be done?)~~ encourage musicians to gain experience by more engagement.
- share about committee visions and my journey as a vice-president
- **Sunday devotion :)**
- ~~be confident that Justin, Vera and Chung will provide more opportunities for members to serve as musicians/gamemasters; liaise with them;~~ regular discuss with committees about serving positions.
- be attentive to others sharing their experience;
- encourage more involvement in larger gatherings (e.g. CNY, P&P, BMT);
- consult other CU members for advice.

# Imperial College Christian Union ICCU
I am gradually retring from ICCU, but would still regularly involve by prayers:
- Regularly involve in *prayer breakfast* and morning first contact
- Asking for prayer updates bi-weekly
- **Post-hub run**.
- ACTION: Liaise with James (Impact Group Leader) with arrangement of regular impact group meetings and departmental outreach programmes.
