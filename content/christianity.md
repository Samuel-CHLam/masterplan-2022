There are mainly two ways I am involved in outreaching as a christian - fellowship (Cantonese Youth Fellowship CYF) and Imperial College Christian Union (ICCU). However due to workload I will be gradually reducing my engagement in ICCU.

# Cantonese Youth Fellowship
As the vice-president of the CYF committee, I am responsible for facilitating President work and coordinating among other committees and participants. During the first term, I organised the freshers' events and provided pastoral supports to the participants.

## Committee
Justin (President), Samuel (Vice-President), Vera (Vice-President *de-facto*, worship and music), Cherry (pastoral), Thomas (secretary), Chung (evangelism and outreach)

## Report

### Things to appreciate
- Despite the initial conflict in the committee, the preparation of programmes was generally well done. The Freshers' Camp (FC) was well-received, and participants generally felt welcomed.
- Glad to see other experienced non-committee members are getting involved in different parts of CYF operations.

### Things to improve
- The initial conflict weakened my bondings with other committee members, and as a result, I was not focusing on my duty.
- I dominated in too many discussions in committee and groups: effective listening is needed.
- There are too many seniors in the committee - events like Praise and Prayer were planned in a rush due to huge academic workload.
- How can we get more people involved and **ensuring them have good spiritual lives?** 

## Working principles

### Communication: Be aware if I have spoken too much in regular meetings: 
- always end with "what do you think?"
- ask questions that are generally accessible to others;
- actively listen to other feedback and wait till they finish to respond;
- ask people if I have spoken too much;
- do not worry about dead air - other people will take care of it.

### Bonding with committee members:
- PRAY;
- start with something simple, e.g. chat, meal, or exercise together;
- do not worry if I am "not close enough" with committee members:  the less worried I am, the better our relationship I could have.

### Bonding with general members:
- PRAY;
- try to prioritise quality than quantity in terms of building relationships with members;
- ACTION: divide among group leaders, committee members and experienced members in providing pastoral and spiritual supports for group members;
- remember it is appropriate to listen without getting involved in an unfamiliar discussion.

### Preparation of programmes: 
- consult Justin before committee meetings if I have any ideas -- in fact, I should do this with other committee members as well;
- allow other committee members to provide feedback.

### Serving in CYF
- I should gradually retire from my role as a CYF musician to provide more training opportunities for others.
- ACTION: ask Vincent/Michael how to be a good mentor of musicians/potential committee members
- ACTION: ask musicians how they can be more involved in music (e.g. how should training be done?)
- share about committee visions and my journey as a vice-president
- be confident that Justin, Vera and Chung will provide more opportunities for members to serve as musicians/gamemasters; liaise with them;
- be attentive to others sharing their experience;
- encourage more involvement in larger gatherings (e.g. CNY, P&P, BMT);
- consult other CU members for advice.d

# Imperial College Christian Union ICCU
I am becoming less active to ICCU, but would still regularly involve by prayers:
- Regularly involve in *prayer breakfast* and morning first contact
- Asking for prayer updates bi-weekly
- ACTION: Liaise with James (Impact Group Leader) with arrangement of regular impact group meetings and departmental outreach programmes.
