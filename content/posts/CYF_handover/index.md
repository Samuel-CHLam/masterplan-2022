This is my little sharing *my* experience as a vice chair in CYF. There are a few notes before we start:
- This is a personal sharing, so views towards issues may be heavily biased. I am always open to further discussions in these matters. 
- There are actually two vice-chairs, since Vera has been appointed to share some of my duties, including the member and committee interviews. 
- This sharing is supplemented with reference materials, which are included in this website.

This has been my forth years joining CYF, and second year working in the CYF committee. It has always been my honor to serve in God's will, and the friendships and partnerships with you guys have made my final years as a teenager being more fruitful and enjoyable. I think it is always nice to reflect on how much we have achieved together - this is best reflected in your engagement in the Break-Me-Through camp, and the follow-up Instagram post for some of you. (Remark: sorry I don't really know what to write in IG so you may expect some delay for this final gratitude post or something...) I am touched in the camp not just because I am anticipating some major breakthroughs in my life, but also the opportunities God has provided us to witness His work of changing lives. I, therefore, truly give thanks to God for making use of our efforts to inspire lives in CYF and other communities around us, and look forward to further God's work.

As you may all know, there is not a clear job description as a vice chair of CYF committee. The main role of being a vice chair is to support the committee (especially chair and devotional supports) by continuously monitoring the needs in fellowship, as well as to help out with duties that has not been taken up by other committees otherwise. I am sure that the upcoming chair (Vera) and vice-chair (Prudence) are fully prepared for the duty, so I don't really have much to say about what a vice chair should do in the committee. Let me therefore jump to some of my reflections during my service this year.

# My general reflections
## Lesson 1: Humbleness
I am quite surprised by how arrogant I am - perhaps because I believed my experience in CYF committee before Covid would be *valuable* to the development. 

Lessons learnt (to be filled in)
- Humbleness
    - A realisation during committee interview.
    - Drawing lines: who am I to judge?
    - Breakthrough in contents.

## Lesson 2: Trust in God, trust in committee
- Trust in committee
    - Member's incidents
    - Expectation of committee.
- Trust in God
    - Reflection on my serving role and academic developments.

## Lesson 3: Be proactive

# Advice
## Advice 1: Vision (and Planning)
Having a clear vision is important for serving, whether you are planning a programme or keeping the passion of serving God. The main purpose of vision is to give a general direction of planning, as well as to bring us back to the right track whenever we get lost in our way.

### Vision for serving
There are many times when one feel burnt out and tired of serving because of the chores associated with our duties. The best way to be powered-up again is to **remember our visions of serving**. Some examples I have heard from the interviews include:
    - to respond to God's love and care through CYF.
    - to improve different aspects to CYF, e.g. quality of relationships among CYF members, quality of programme...
    - to utilise the spiritual gifts from God, e.g. ability to understand others' feeling, understanding of bible, ability to share experiences, musicianship...

I am personally encouraged when hearing the motivation of service, and I hope that you will remember the above responses whenever you feel discouraged in your service.

### Vision for programmes (and development)
Vision gives you a general direction of planning programme and growth of CYF as a fellowship. Vision ensures the programmes are actually telling a coherent story. This would enable us to **follow-up** easily with participants, so that they would be constantly reminded of the programme contents and help them to apply what they have learnt in daily life.

Last year's vision is to "learn and act like Jesus" (學像耶穌, 活像耶穌). This is a very good vision as it echoes with the church vision.
- Term 1: we started off with explaining the ways to know Jesus more and building relationships with Him, including praying, devotion and reading Bible. 
- Term 2: we begin by reflecting our sin, before discussing how to be a disciple and live up God's teaching through our worship, fellowship and evangelism.

Unfortunately, the theme for final term is not very clear for a few reasons.
- We want to further strengthen participants' relationship with God.
- We want to accommodate standard programmes like *Boy-Girl Relationship*.
- We plan this term in a rush.

So our storyline did not end well and many get confused at the end. I feel pity that we could not *follow up* on some of the things the participants have discussed, in particular, their goals set during the Freshers' Camp and the programme on 15/1. I would hope that there is a clearer vision for next year's programme.

### Thinking of vision
Although I am a keen advocate of planning programmes by vision, I often find it very hard to think of one. Perhaps my advice is impractical for some of the people, as suggested by [this song](https://www.instagram.com/p/CVNVv-7oU8e/). (Remark: this song forms part of Vera's sharing on Instagram). I recognise there is no way out except to humble before God, praying that God would lead us the way.

Here I point out some potential themes, based on observations in the committee last year. Hope these are helpful.
- Fundamental issues in christianity: putting emphasis on *experiencing* sin, salvation and relationship with God. This is a follow up for those joining BMT, and at the same time an opportunity for newcomers to reflect on their faith.
- Act as disciples in school and in workplace. This would help participants to actually live out God's teaching in daily life. Moreover, being the "salt and light" in our communities helps others to see God's work and encourage them to explore the Gospel.
- Evangelism: this is part of the aim of CYF. I remembered of CYF sharing the principles of evangelism before the freshers' events and at the middle of spring term. It would be useful to share some practical tips of evangelism, as well as provide opportunities for participants to put the theories into practice.
- Respond to social issues in christian way. That includes wars, injustice, and yes you guessed it, marriage and LGBT.

## Advice 2: Time management
> Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom. (Psalm 90:12)

## Advice 3: Committee as fellowship

## Advice 4: Leadership



## Advice 5: Enjoy the service!
