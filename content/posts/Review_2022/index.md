Dear readers,

Thank you for reading my review of 2022, which highlights significant achievements made during the year, my reflections and my rough planning for 2023. 

Perhaps the biggest highlight of the year would be my graduation from Imperial College. If you know me well, then you would recognise that this was also my graduation for my primary and high school, as I haven't been formally graduating from those places. It is my pleasure to join the EPSRC CDT of Random Systems at University of Oxford to pursue my further studies in the theory of deep learning. This would not be possible without the help from God, as well as family and friends.

Please continue to read the next few chapters of my review, and I hope you would enjoy reading them.

Samuel Lam,
February 2022.
