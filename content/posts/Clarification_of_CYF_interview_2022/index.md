> *This is a guidance valid in the academic year of 2021-22. Some policies may be altered for this academic year.*

TL;DR: 
- Clarification for confirmation of faith
- Interview process

The CYF is governed by a committee, supervised by a panel of advisors. The committee is formed by an election under the simple majority system to allow equal representation from different parties in CYF. We believe that CYF committees are elected under the guidance of the *same* Holy Spirit. 

> For through Him (God) we both have access to the Father by one Spirit. (Ephesians 2:18)

To ensure the integrity of the election, only *CYF members* are allowed to vote and/or be elected during general meetings. Any participants that satisfy the following criteria may be admitted as a *CYF member*, subject to the approval of the chair and vice-chair of CYF committee.
- Being a christian
- Attendance requirement: to attend at least six out of nine consective CYF programmes.

# Confirming your faith
**The chair and vice-chair of the CYF committee, under supervision of advisors, have the final say on whether a candidate is admitted as a CYF member.** Candidates are encouraged to reflect on the following teachings taken from the first chapter of *Handbook on Follow Up* (茁苗查經), written by Paul and Ruth Li (李保羅、李榮鳳), and to see if he/she agrees with the following teachings.

1. God created us in His image (Genesis 1:26-31), and that we belong to Him. (1 Corinthian 10:26)
2. We have committed sin (Romans 3:23), and therefore separated from God and died. (Romans 6:23)
3. We cannot save ourselves (Ephesians 2:8-9)
4. God loves us and therefore sent Jesus to sacrifice for us... (John 3:15-17, Romans 5:8)
5. ...so that through him we may live. (1 Peter 2:24, 1 John 5:11-13)
6. We repent and invite God to govern our lives. (1 John 1:9, John 1:12).

In addition, candidates are strongly advised to review the [doctrinal basis of CCiL](https://ccil.org.uk/en/about-us/our-church/), which is written based on the Apostle creed.

# Interview
Committees would confirm your faith through interview. A typical way to confirm your faith is to ask the following question
> How would you be sure that you have received God salvation? 

In addition, committees may ask questions on your relationship with God and experience in CYF, so that CYF could better support your faith journey. You are *required* to respond to this question with honesty, for the obvious reason to maintain the integrity for the committee elections. In addition, candidates are *strongly encouraged* to raise any further concerns on your faith status and any issues related to CYF.
