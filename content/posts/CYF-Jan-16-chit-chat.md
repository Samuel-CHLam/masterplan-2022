Quick notes from a discussion with CYF friends during the fellowship on 16/1/2021. I have just finished my Dynamics of Games homework and have been exhausted, so I decided to listen and I enjoy that so much. I am also glad that Yanni share my website to others.

- Jocelyn: Don't worry about deadair. (Although "introverts are happy if extroverts take over".)
- Joseph: Go beyond being silent and try to respond to others sharing. They need your encouragement.
- Enjoy the discussion with an aim to complete the main objective of discussion. 
- Don't force, we can always find another time to do.
