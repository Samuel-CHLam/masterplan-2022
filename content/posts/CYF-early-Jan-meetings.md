The following is a summary for two meetings of CYF, happening on 30/12/2021 (Thursday) and 6/1/2022 (Wednesday). Both meetings are happening in Zoom.

Committee: Justin (President), Samuel (Vice-President), Vera (Vice-President *de-facto*, worship and music), Cherry (pastoral), Thomas (secretary), Chung (evangelism and outreach)

# Covid Arrangement
- Many CYF participants caught Covid after the gathering on 26/12/2021 (Sunday), and we have prayed for their recoveries.
- CYF is turning online. CYF will resume normal no later than February. As a result, 
    - the length of programme is reduced to 30 minutes
    - worship will be done by playing Youtube videos
    - there will be no games
    - there will be members' sharing.

# My reflection
- I had submitted ideas to the programme contents, and I generally appreciate Justins' constructive feedback. As a more seasoned group leader, Justin had pointed out many ways of improvement. I will therefore pay attention to the feedback as a process to gain more experience.
- Justin pointed out that due to the diversity of participants, participants might have different takeaways from the same programme depending on their experience. A programme should therefore be inclusive by involving different levels of reflective questions. For example, one can ask early believers about whether they would like to serve during the "serving" programme while encouraging experienced believers to reflect on challenges faced during their service.
