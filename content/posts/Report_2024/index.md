# Academic Work
This academic year was blessed with the end of CDT coursework and numerous mini-projects, leading to the successful transition to a DPhil student. My research focused on the asymptotics of neural networks, the fundamental ingredient of many successful models in machine learning. As the number of parameters increases, neural networks usually exhibit more tractable behaviour, which contributes to the development of cleaner approaches to studying the training of neural networks. 

I completed mini-projects on analysing the use of neural networks to solve reinforcement learning problems [^1] and understanding the difficulties of training neural networks with fewer active neurons [^2]. I presented the latter project at the 12th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) - one of the most well-attended machine learning conferences. We are grateful for the generous financial support of the College (through the Old Members' Trust Graduate Conference and Academic Travel Fund) and the Department. The travel report will be published on the College website shortly. 

I have since moved on to studying recurrent neural networks (RNNs), designed to model sequential objects by incorporating neurons that store the history of the sequence. However, the memory layer makes it difficult to compute accurate parameter updates because they depend on the complete input and output sequences. We aim to determine whether it is appropriate to forget some of the history of the input and output sequences when computing an estimate of the exact parameter updates without compromising training performance. We have published preliminary results [^3] for simple RNNs, and we look forward to extending our analyses to different asymptotic bounds and more sophisticated RNN architectures, including standard large language models in Llama.

# Extra-curricular Activities
My extra-curricular commitments have focused on communicating with members of the Postgraduate College. As the outgoing WCR External Affairs Officer, I represented the WCR on the Student Council and Representative Committee within the Student Union. I have also developed a new website for the Weir Common Room (WCR, available at wcr.univ.ox.ac.uk) to improve communication with members of the Postgraduate College. We will continue to work with the Digital Communications Office and the Common Rooms to streamline the promotion of College events and improve the freshers' experience.

I have also become increasingly involved in the College's music scenes. Recently elected as Secretary of the University Music Society (UCMS), I am keen to promote College music events to more members (especially postgraduates) and ensure that anyone who wants to perform, whether professional or amateur, can do so. We recently raised over Â£22,000 for a new rehearsal space on Giving Day, thanks to the generous donations of 69 donors and matching funds from old members, and we are excited to see where this will take us. A full report will be available in the Martlets magazine shortly.

# Greatest achievements
Publishing the two pre-prints and another major conference paper would be the most substantial achievement. These are excellent exercises to rigorously formulate mathematical frameworks that help us understand the reasons behind the tremendous success of neural networks in recent years. These publications have opened up further discussions with academics - and I am delighted to learn how mathematics could benefit human life through these discussions.

# Personal Message
We have had a surprisingly fruitful year in both academic and extra-curricular aspects. Thank you so much for supporting our studentships, which enables the College community to thrive. It is my pleasure to be with this vibrant Univ community.

Time flies, and it is time for more academic work. I am eager to tackle more fundamental unsolved questions about neural networks relevant to numerous daily applications and to share my knowledge with the University communities. Please do look forward to my upcoming reports on academics and contributions to our communities.
