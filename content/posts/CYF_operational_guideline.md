# New: Interviews and Elections
## Interview
- Faith criteria (have to be christians (**重新得救**的基督徒)). What does it mean to be christian? Drawing a line is difficult.
- Attendance criteria. How to deal with people who joined late.
- Very time consuming: we have ~10 new members this year, so 10 hours of interview.

## Election
- Prepare beforehand: try to share what you have done as a committee, so that you don't have to say too much during interview / handover. 
- Know the rules from the constitution.
- Another 8-9 hours of interview
