This is my little sharing *my* experience as a vice chair in CYF. There are a few notes before we start. First of all, this is a personal sharing, so views towards issues may be heavily biased, and I am always open to further discussions in these matters. Secondly, there are actually two vice-chairs, since Vera has been appointed to share some of my duties, including the member and committee interviews. Finally, the sharing is supplemented with reference materials, which are included in this website.

This has been my forth years joining CYF, and second year working in the CYF committee. It has always been my honor to serve in God's will, and the friendships and partnerships with you guys have made my final years as a teenager being more fruitful and enjoyable. I think it is always nice to reflect on how much we have achieved together - this is best reflected in your engagement in the Break-Me-Through camp, and the follow-up Instagram post for some of you. (Remark: sorry I don't really know what to write in IG so you may expect some delay for this final gratitude post or something...) I am touched in the camp not just because I am anticipating some major breakthroughs in my life, but also the opportunities God has provided us to witness His work of changing lives. I, therefore, truly give thanks to God for making use of our efforts to inspire lives in CYF and other communities around us, and look forward to further God's work.

# My general reflections
As you may all know, there is not a clear job description as a vice chair of CYF committee. The main role of being a vice chair is to support the committee (especially chair and devotional supports) by continuously monitoring the needs in fellowship, as well as to help out with duties that has not been taken up by other committees otherwise. I am sure that the upcoming chair (Vera) and vice-chair (Prudence) are fully prepared for the duty, so I don't really have much to say about what a vice chair should do in the committee. Let me therefore jump to some of the lessons learnt during my service this year.

Lessons learnt (to be filled in)
- Humbleness
- Trust in God
- Trust in committee

# Important reminders
- Vision: I think having a clear direction is way more important. 
- Time management
> Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom. (Psalm 90:12)
- Understand others
- Leadership
- Enjoy!

## Programme Planning
- We have members with various experience in faith, so it is difficult to cater all needs. Rest assured that there are many "more experienced" members that could possibly help the "less experienced" people, but we also have to take care of others as well.
- Consideration of supporting study groups. Previous years we have 

## New: Interviews and Elections
### Interview
- Faith criteria (have to be christians (**重新得救**的基督徒)). What does it mean to be christian? Drawing a line is difficult.
- Attendance criteria. How to deal with people who joined late.
- Very time consuming: we have ~10 new members this year, so 10 hours of interview.

### Election
- Prepare beforehand: try to share what you have done as a committee, so that you don't have to say too much during interview / handover. 
- Know the rules from the constitution.
- Another 8-9 hours of interview
