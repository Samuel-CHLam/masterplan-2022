# Jonah
## Day 1: Jonah 1:1-13
Jesus asked Jonah to preach against the great city of Nineveh, but Jonah ran away and boarded a ship at Tarshish.

- The wickedness of Nineveh scared Jonah away.
- Interesting that Jonah asked the sailors to throw him into the sea. 
- Do you think Jonah is a good servant of God?
