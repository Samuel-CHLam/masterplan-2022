Time: *8.30am - 9.15am* every Sunday.
Content: discussion of prescribed materials and catchup. We will be reading 1 John.

# Timetable
## 16/1 (Samuel) - Chapter 1
- What is the *word of life* (v2)?
- What is the aim of writing this book?
    - Many scholars believe John was writing the book to clarify important doctrines due to the emergence of false teachings. (See [here](https://www.ccbiblestudy.org/New%20Testament/62%201John/62CT00.htm).)
    - John wrote in verse 3-4: *...that you too may have **fellowship** with us; and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ. And we are writing these things so that our **joy** may be complete.* What is your view on this passage? Does this passage remind you of the fundamentals of the fellowship? Is our joy complete in our daily lives?
- How do we respond to God being the light of the world? Reflect on your daily life.
