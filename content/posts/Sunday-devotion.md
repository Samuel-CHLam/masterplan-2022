# Logistics
Venue: McDonald's in Hammersmith Broadway
Time: *8.30am - 9.15am* every Sunday.
Content: discussion of prescribed materials and catchup. We will be reading 1 John.

# Timetable
## 16/1 (Samuel) - Chapter 1
- What is the *word of life* (v2)?
- What is the aim of writing this book?
    - Many scholars believe John was writing the book to clarify important doctrines due to the emergence of false teachings. (See [here](https://www.ccbiblestudy.org/New%20Testament/62%201John/62CT00.htm).)
    - John wrote in verse 3-4: *...that you too may have **fellowship** with us; and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ. And we are writing these things so that our **joy** may be complete.* What is your view on this passage? Does this passage remind you of the fundamentals of the fellowship? Is our joy complete in our daily lives?
- How do we respond to God being the light of the world? Reflect on your daily life.

## 23/1 (Tim) - Chapter 2:1-6
- This is an extension of the last paragraph of Chapter 1. Indeed, John often repeated and elaborated his points over and over.
- We "know Jesus" by continuously meditating on his words and practising his teaching. Note the subtlety here: keeping a commandment is NOT a *prerequisite* of "knowing Jesus" or enjoying God's salvation, but is a clear indication of how much we understand our faith.
- How do we know more about Jesus? How can we be persistent with keeping his commandments?

## 30/1 (Joseph) - Chapter 2:7-17
- What is the *new* command? Is the *new* command actually *new*?
- Why did John write the letters to other people?
- How do we respond to the world's temptations?
