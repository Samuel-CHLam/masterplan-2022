# Logistics
Venue: McDonald's in Hammersmith Broadway
Time: *8.30am - 9.15am* every Sunday.
Content: discussion of prescribed materials and catchup. We will be reading 1 John.

# Timetable
## 16/1 (Samuel) - Chapter 1
- What is the *word of life* (v2)?
- What is the aim of writing this book?
    - Many scholars believe John was writing the book to clarify important doctrines due to the emergence of false teachings. (See [here](https://www.ccbiblestudy.org/New%20Testament/62%201John/62CT00.htm).)
    - John wrote in verse 3-4: *...that you too may have **fellowship** with us; and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ. And we are writing these things so that our **joy** may be complete.* What is your view on this passage? Does this passage remind you of the fundamentals of the fellowship? Is our joy complete in our daily lives?
- How do we respond to God being the light of the world? Reflect on your daily life.

## 23/1 (Tim) - Chapter 2:1-6
- This is an extension of the last paragraph of Chapter 1. Indeed, John often repeated and elaborated his points over and over.
- We "know Jesus" by continuously meditating on his words and practising his teaching. Note the subtlety here: keeping a commandment is NOT a *prerequisite* of "knowing Jesus" or enjoying God's salvation, but is a clear indication of how much we understand our faith.
- How do we know more about Jesus? How can we be persistent with keeping his commandments?

## 30/1 (Joseph) - Chapter 2:7-17
- What is the *new* command? Is the *new* command actually *new*?
- Why did John write the letters to other people?
- How do we respond to the world's temptations?

## 6/2 - Paused

## 13/2 (Harman) - Chapter 2:18-27
Question:
- What are the characteristics of the "antichrists"? Do you think you are one of them?
- How are we being *anointed*? (v20)
- What were the things the readers have "heard from the beginning"? (v21)
- What does it mean by "abide"? Do you think what you have heard "abide in you"? Do you think you are "abide in the Son and in the Father"? What is the promise? (v24-25)
- What is the message of v27? Why did author say so? How should we treat the teaching from the "anointing you received from him" and from human?

Seek advice
- What is the "anointing you received from him"? (v20)
- How should we treat the teachings from people? (v27)

Notes:
- v18 - "last hour" 
- v18 - "the antichrist" and "antichrists" (v22)
- v20 - "anointing" = spirits
- v20 - "all or anything"
- v22 - can refer to both "the antichrist" and "antichrist"
- v24 *what you have heard from the beginning*
- v24 *abide* - very important or "imperative" -- tok chin
- v27 - "As for you"
- v27 - "anyone should teach you"

- What is "believe" (v1)?
- How do we know we love God?
- Notice the subtle difference between "carrying out" and "keeping" His commands. 
- What is the authority behind our "victory" over the world (v4)? Are you convinced by that? Share something you learn over "the end" yesterday.
