Let us conclude the review by covering the following 

# Webpage development service
In 2022 I have joined the Imperial College Mathematics Society (MathSoc) and Rail and Transport Society (ICRTS) as a webmaster to upgrade their society website. The website has been upgraded from the PHP framework to the user-family `React.js` framework, and efforts have been made to improve the design of the website. My duties as webmaster were successfully handed over to new committee members, including Chris Boddy (MathSoc) and Madalina Ioana-Sas (ICRTS).

# Music
## Choral Work
I have had opportunities to engaged in multiple choral singing activities. The highlight of the year would be to attend a John Rutter's singing day on the 9th April, in which we tried out his new piece commissioned for the Ukrainian war, his Requiem, and a few of his anthems. It was such a wonderful experience to learn more about the story behind his work while singing with other like-minded choral enthusiasts.

I have also been fortunate to engage in a few choir performances in the Chinese Churches in London (CCiL), and Christmas carols for Imperial College Christian Union (ICCU). I would love to join the chapel choir of my college (University College) in the future.

## Organ Work
It is also my pleasure to learn how to play organ with Alex Newton, an organ scholar of my college! I am currently working on some Bach chorales (BWV600, BWV647), and would aim to start working on other pieces (e.g. Brahms' *Elf Choralvorspieles* and Bach's *Trio Sonata*) before the end of the next academic year.

# Travelling
## Sightseeing
I have only travelled to Spain (Seville, Cordoba, Malaga) for sightseeing outside of the country, and maybe I will write another review of the trip if time allows. A trip to Poland was cancelled due to my student visa applications. 

## Inside the country
I have also travelled to
- Southend - to enjoy the Great British Railway discount (Â£4 pounds for a return ticket!!)
- Isle of Wight - see below
- Ringwood
- Reading

## Railway
I have also attended the following activities related to railway transport
- Isle of Wight - to visit a South-Western Railway depot that maintains the "D-train" (bi-mode train converted from the District line "D-stock").
- Crossrail openings
- Opening of Barking Riverside station - during the hottest day of the history in the UK.
- Multiple Underground Challenges hosted by the ICRTS
- Travelled by Crosscountry trains for the first time in my life.

# Conclusion
So that's all for my review and thanks for reading!
