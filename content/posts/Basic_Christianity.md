Some summary and notes from the book *Basic Christianity* by John Stott.

# Chapter 1: The Right Approach
God has taken initiatives to reveal Himself through creation, salvation and revelation.

## God demonstrating Himself
- God has spoken
- *God has acted.* Review the whole story of salvation from the rescue from Egypt to final salvation. (See perhaps Acts.)

## How should we respond?
> Seek and you shall find. (Matthew)
- Seek *humbly* and admits that we need God's wisdom to understand Him completely. Having rational mind is OK but we must admits our limitations.
- Seek *honestly* and lay aside our prejudice
- Seek *obediently* and be obedient to the teaching, letting God's initiatives change our lives.

# Chapter 2: Christ's claim
- Self-centered teaching
- Direct claims
- Indirect claims
- Dramatised claims

# Chapter 3: Character of Christ
Christ is distinguished from human because He is sinless. We should therefore treat Him not as a powerful human, but rather some form of super-naturals. 

# Chapter 4: Resurrection of Christ
Resurrection of Christ distinguishes Him from being a human (so is His conception).

## Evidence of resurrection
For the following references, try to
- point out the evidence as listed in the Bible
- examine the alternative arguments

1. The body has gone.
    *Alternative arguments:*
    - *The women went to the wrong tomb*: not plausible since the sky is not completely dark, there were people going in different time-points, and the people visited not just for the sentiments.
    - *Coma theory*: contradicts with Pilate's observation of "blood and water"
    - *Thieves stole the body*: the Romans had prepared for that
    - *Disciples stole the body*: similar reasons above. Disciples might not want to devote their lives on the artificial theory that Jesus had risen.
    - *Romans/Jewish took the body*: they could have shown part of Jesus' body to disprove the teachings in the New Testaments.
2. Graveclothes were undisturbed
3. Jesus was seen
    *Alternative arguments:*
    - *Invention:* unlikely, since other senses were involved.
    - *Hallucination:* people were not that desperate to see Jesus. Also note the variety of settings and atmosphere when Jesus appeared.
4. Disciples were changed.
