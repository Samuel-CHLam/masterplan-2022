Some summary and notes from the book *Basic Christianity* by John Stott.

# Chapter 1: The Right Approach
God has taken initiatives to reveal Himself through creation, revelation (啟示) and salvation.

## God demonstrating Himself
- God has spoken
    - Natural revelation: demonstrated to everyone through his creation.
    - Special revelation: demonstrated by a group of the "special messengers" to the "special people". We are fortunate to acknowledge this revelation through evangelism.
- *God has acted* because observation is what we need (due to our sinful and skeptical nature.) Review the whole story of salvation from the rescue from Egypt to final salvation. (See perhaps Acts.)

## How should we respond?
> Seek and you shall find. (Matthew)
- Seek *seriously* and work hard.
- Seek *humbly* and admits that we need God's wisdom to understand Him completely. Having rational mind is OK but we must admits our limitations.
- Seek *honestly* and lay aside our prejudice
- Seek *obediently* and be obedient to the teaching, letting God's initiatives change our lives.

> Questions:
> 1. Jesus once said "If anyone choose to do God's will, he will find out whether my teaching comes from God or whether I speak on my own." In such case, how can someone who reject God find out who God is?
> 2. Why did God reveal in stages? (Hint: Think about the relationship between God and human.)

# Chapter 2: Christ's claim
## Self-centered teaching
- Try to understand God through His descriptions about Himself.
Some snapshots:
- Way of truth (compare with *"That is the truth, so far as I understand it; follow that."*) 
> I am the way and the truth and the life. No-one comes to the Father except through me. (John 14)
- Identity
> "Who do you say I am?" (Mark 8)
- Commandment (vs. invitation): e.g. "Come to me...", "Follow me..."
- Prediction of salvation plan.
> I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.
- Why can God be *self-centered* and *self-seeking*?

## Different claims
1. Direct claims: his relationship with the Father, comparison with other important figures like Abraham.
2. Indirect claims
    - Forgiving sin.
    - Give life. (e.g. "living water".)
    - Teach the truth. 
    > No-one ever spoke the way this man does.
    > ...the crowds were amazed at his teaching, because he taught as one who had *authority*, and not as their teachers of the law.
    - Judge the world (when He returns.)
3. Dramatised claims through miracles and signs (see John).
Claims are supported by His character.

# Chapter 3: Character of Christ
Christ is distinguished from human because He is sinless. We should therefore treat Him not as a powerful human, but rather some form of super-naturals. 

# Chapter 4: Resurrection of Christ
Resurrection of Christ distinguishes Him from being a human (so is His conception).

## Evidence of resurrection
For the following references, try to
- point out the evidence as listed in the Bible
- examine the alternative arguments

1. The body has gone.
    *Alternative arguments:*
    - *The women went to the wrong tomb*: not plausible since the sky is not completely dark, there were people going in different time-points, and the people visited not just for the sentiments.
    - *Coma theory*: contradicts with Pilate's observation of "blood and water"
    - *Thieves stole the body*: the Romans had prepared for that
    - *Disciples stole the body*: similar reasons above. Disciples might not want to devote their lives on the artificial theory that Jesus had risen.
    - *Romans/Jewish took the body*: they could have shown part of Jesus' body to disprove the teachings in the New Testaments.
2. Graveclothes were undisturbed
3. Jesus was seen
    *Alternative arguments:*
    - *Invention:* unlikely, since other senses were involved.
    - *Hallucination:* people were not that desperate to see Jesus. Also note the variety of settings and atmosphere when Jesus appeared.
4. Disciples were changed.

# Chapter 5: The fact and nature of sin
> Sin is not a convenient invention of church ministers to keep them in their job; it is a fact of human experience.
Sin is universal to human.

## Ten commandments
Three stages of keeping commandments:
- Not taking action
- Not intending to act
- Acting in accordance to the positive counterparts. (*"But rather..."*)

1. You shall have no other gods before me.
    - This includes putting others above God, e.g. sport, hobby, selfish ambition.
    - One should "love the Lord our God with all our heart and with all our soul and with all our mind". No one has ever kept this commandment except Jesus.
2. You shall not make for yourself an image.
    - How we worship? Do we perform worshipping acts without actually worshipping Him? We should worship "in the Spirit and in truth".
3. You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God.
    - Mind our languages.
    - Do we actually trust and obey God?
4. Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy.
    - What do we do in our Sundays?
5. Honour your father and your mother.
6. You shall not murder
    - This includes being angry with someone without good reason, or to be insulting.
    - *Rather* promote the health and support the life of others
7. You should not commit adultery.
    - Sex outside relationship
    - Adulterous thoughts
    - Remember sex is a gift of God.
8. You shall not steal.
    - This includes overworking and underpaying staff as an employer, as well as working short hours as an employee.
    - *Rather* start working.
9. You shall not give false testimony against your neighbour.
    - This includes gossiping, lying, deliberate exaggeration or distorting the truth.
10. You shall not covet (~greedy).

# Chapter 6: Consequences of Sin
- Alienation (疏遠) from God, death.
    - Structure of the tabernacle
    - Fear of seeing God's face in the old testament
    - Our experience of "distant" God in the new testament
- Bring us to captivity (囚禁)
    - Sin is an internal sickness that we are in bondage.
    - We want to live a good life, but we are chained in the prison of our self-centeredness. However much we may boast of being free, the reality is that we are slaves.
    - A lecture wil not solve our problem; we need a Saviour.
- Conflict with others

Conclusion: admit our need for a cure.

# Chapter 7: Death of Christ
## Centrality of the Cross (as bridge)
> the life of a creature is in the blood (Leviticus 17:11)
> without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness (Hebrews 9:22)
This is the plan according to the Old Testament (Zechariah, Daniel, Isaiah)

## Meaning of the Cross
- Sorry, most of the planning remain a mystery.
- The author deliberately limit his discussion to 1 Peter, because
    - he was one of the inner core of three apostles.
    - Simon Peter had paid much effort to accept the planning for Jesus to sacrifice.
    - the reference to the Cross is an aside in his letter.
- Christ suffering is an *example* for us to submit to undeserved suffering.
- **That is not enough.** Christ suffering is for our *sin*, that's why Jesus struggled to "have the cup".
    - Someone might be responsible for our sin. (E.g. Number 30 concerning vows, end of Lamentations, Proverbs?)
    - Sin offering in Leviticus 10
    - John the Baptist: "Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world."
    - Reference in Exodus (the *Passover Lamb*)
- No good behaviour on our part could ever earn our forgiveness.

# Chapter 8: Salvation of Christ
- *Salvation:* not just forgiveness of previous mistakes, but also put right our relationship with Him, then progressively set us free from our sinful nature.
- *Spirit of Christ:*
    - Need the death of Christ
    > Unless I go away, the Advocate will not come to you, but if I go, I will send Him to you. (John 14)
    - Essential for our transforming lives: letting spirit come to our heart and change us from the inside.
- *Church of Christ*
    - Restore our relationships with one another.
    - Church = all disciples.
    - Paul: Church as a body (Ephesians 4), energised by a common life -- the Holy Spirit.
        - Holy Spirit is the creator of our common love.
    - Couldn't reject church since we were having same nature as it...
    > Question: John Stott stated that "those who declare faith in Christ..." and "those who actually exercise faith" are not identical. Are you concerned by that?

# Chapter 9: Counting the cost
> What shall I do, Lord? (Acts)

> Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me. (Luke 8:29)

Need to reflect on the cost of following Christ. Unfortunately many people treated the religion as a cushion.

## Following Christ
1. Renunciation of sin: Repentance = turning away from every thought, word, deed and habit that we know to be wrong. This include making any realistic reparation.
2. Renunciation of self: surrender to him the rights over our own lives. By losing our own selves we discover our true selves?
3. Taking up the cross: complete surrender of self...

Application
- Career pathway
- Marriage and home
- Money and time

## Acknowledging Christ
> Do not be ashamed of the Lord.
- Baptism
- Sharing with our communities

## Incentives
- For our own sake. (Remember John 10:10)
- For the sake of others. (Light and salt of the world)
- For Christ sake.
