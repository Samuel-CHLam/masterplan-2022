The following contents are taken from a discussion with my mother on 6/1/2022 (Thursday).

# Basic Principles
- Reflect on the expected achievements of plans everyday as a way to keep us going
- Start brainstorming with big direction, then set up easy (small) targets following the direction.
- It is easy to get lost: think about the example of Peter walking on the sea, and how Jesus responded when Peter hesitated. (Matthew 14:22-33, Bible)
- Successful planning involves lots of research and discussions
- Mind your language
- Be flexible, "be water my friend" (Bruce Lee)

# Basic elements of a plan
- knowledge
- skill
- habit (usually 21 days or 49 days)
- attitude

# How to seek advice?
- The 5W1H - Who? What? Where? When? Why? How?
- Ask for *key points*.
- A meal is not necessary, a zoom meeting or a WhatsApp discussion is sufficient.
- Limit a meeting to 45-90 minutes, depending on the size of meeting.
- Set reasonable deadlines.
