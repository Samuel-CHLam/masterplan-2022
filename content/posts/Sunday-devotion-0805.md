We will be reading Matthew 19:16-30, the story of a rich man. If you have time, you may wish to continue reading the parable of the workers in the vineyard in Matthew 20:16, but this will only be covered briefly.

# Questions
1. By only just verse 26, can you infer what the verse is about?
2. In verse 17 Jesus said "there is only One who is good". Who was the One? Was it the rich man?
3. If you were one of the disciples, would you be surprised by Jesus' reaction?
4. Now interpret verse 26 again - what is it all about? 
5. Do you think the disciple understand what Jesus is talking about? 
6. How did Jesus clarify? (Extra: what does it mean by "many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first"?)
7. Does your answer to question 1 coincide with question 4?

# A bit of sharing
It seems that verse 26 is a good word of encouragement, especially for those who are frustrated with work. From the verse, it makes sense for us to ask God fulfill our seemingly impossible wish by "lifting them up" through prayers. This is technically fine, but one might miss the more important message if we decided to interpret this verse in this particular way.

Let us step back and look at the context. Here was a rich man approaching to Jesus, asking how one might get the eternal life by doing *good things*. Looking from hindsight, we know that it is impossible (e.g. see Ephesians 2:8-9), but we from the passages that both the disciples and the rich man were not convinced. That is why Jesus said this verse: "with man this (getting the eternal life) this is impossible, but with God all things are possible". Indeed, we cannot get eternal lives by our efforts because only God is perfect in nature (see verse 17); we can only get it through God's grace instead.

Let us not forget that God is here not just to fulfill our needs. In John 10:10, Jesus said he came so that we may have (eternal) life "and have it to the full". If we truly believe that eternal life is the best thing you could ever get from God, why should one worry about worldly things then? The challenge from God in verse 21 is hence less challenging, in the sense that wealth should not be a concern of the rich man comparing to having "full life". 

This teaching applies to us. Therefore, let us check if we are convinced that the eternal life is the best gift from God. If so, are we ready to give up the wordly desire and follow him.
