# Serving in the Cantonese Youth Fellowship
Cantonese Youth Fellowship (CYF) is a fellowship in the Chinese Churches in London (CCiL), and has been nurturing many leaders that would later serve CCiL. It has been my priviledge to stay in CYF for four years, and to serve in the CYF committee for my second time. In particular, I have been extremely touched by reading members testimonies from the Break-me-through camp and baptism of some of the members, as God has demonstrated his power through the life-changing stories.

Working as a vice-chair has been challenging, and I am delighted to collaborate with the chair (Justin Leung), the vice-chair *de-facto* (Vera Shek) and other committee members in delivering the programmes for the CYF. Our vision during my tenure is to encourage members to "learn and act like Jesus" (學像耶穌, 活像耶穌) in line with the CCiL's general vision.

In term 1 we started off with explaining the ways to know Jesus more and building relationships with Him, including praying, devotion and reading Bible, followed by an invitation to submit ourselves to God. We have focused in term 2 by reflecting our sin, before discussing how to be a disciple and live up God's teaching through our worship, fellowship and evangelism. The final term consists of assorted programmes that encourage members to respond to issues in our daily lives, such as how to develop a God-centered *boy-girl relationships* and supporting refugees from around the world. The year ends with a break-through camp that encourages members to reflect on the past and prepare for the breakthroughs that could make them a better christian in the future. Overall, it has been encouraging to see how members enjoy CYF as a family of believers that share a common core-value. I am also delighted to see some members who decided to declare their faith in public through baptism, and/or commiting themselves to further service (e.g. committees, mission trips).

There is not a clear job description for the role as a vice chair. The main role of being a vice chair is to support the committee (especially chair and devotional supports) by continuously monitoring the needs in fellowship, as well as to help out with duties that has not been taken up by other committees otherwise. Perhaps the most challenging duty would be to carry out interviews for members and prospective committees. The former is to access the current faiths and needs for the newly-joined participants, and the latter is to access the preparedness for a member to serve in the CYF committee. I am also delighted to re-launch the Sunday prayer breakfast before the sermon, as well as leading a few bible studies during a CYF programme / Sunday bible study. All these achievements would not have been possible without the blessings from God and prayers from different communities.

Please also read my reflections on my service as the vice-chair of CYF committee.
