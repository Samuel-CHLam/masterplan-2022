# Serving in the Cantonese Youth Fellowship
Cantonese Youth Fellowship (CYF) is a fellowship in the Chinese Churches in London (CCiL), and has been nurturing many leaders that would later serve CCiL. It has been my priviledge to stay in CYF for four years, and to serve in the CYF committee for my second time. In particular, I have been extremely touched by reading members testimonies from the Break-me-through camp and baptism of some of the members, as God has demonstrated his power through the life-changing stories.

Working as a vice-chair has been challenging, and I am delighted to collaborate with the chair (Justin Leung), the vice-chair *de-facto* (Vera Shek) and other committee members in delivering the programmes for the CYF. Our vision during my tenure is to encourage members to "learn and act like Jesus" (學像耶穌, 活像耶穌) in line with the CCiL's general vision.

In term 1 we started off with explaining the ways to know Jesus more and building relationships with Him, including Bible reading, devotion and prayer (讀經、靈修、祈禱), followed by an invitation to submit ourselves to God (將生命主權交給神). We have focused in term 2 by reflecting our sin (罪), before discussing how to be a disciple and live up God's teaching through our worship, fellowship and evangelism. The final term consists of assorted programmes that encourage members to respond to issues in our daily lives, such as how to develop a God-centered *boy-girl relationships* and supporting refugees from around the world. The year ends with a break-me-throughthrough camp (BMT) that encourages members to reflect on the past and prepare for the breakthroughs that could make them a better christian in the future. Overall, it has been encouraging to see how members enjoy CYF as a family of believers that share a common core-value. I am also delighted to see some members who decided to declare their faith in public through baptism, and/or commiting themselves to further service (e.g. committees, mission trips).

There is not a clear job description for the role as a vice chair. The main role of being a vice chair is to support the committee (especially chair and devotional supports) by continuously monitoring the needs in fellowship, as well as to help out with duties that has not been taken up by other committees otherwise. Perhaps the most challenging duty would be to carry out interviews for members and prospective committees. The former is to access the current faiths and needs for the newly-joined participants, and the latter is to access the preparedness for a member to serve in the CYF committee. I am also delighted to re-launch the Sunday prayer breakfast before the sermon, as well as leading a few bible studies during a CYF programme / Sunday bible study. All these achievements would not have been possible without the blessings from God and prayers from different communities.

# Summer at CCiL
During the summer of 2022, I have been honored to serve in various roles in CCiL. They have enriched my experience in CCiL before I head to Oxford.

## AV supports and worship team
I am delighted to join the Audio-Visual (AV) team to provide AV supports for the Cantonese services. In addition, I am honoured to collaborate with other members of CCiL for music worships as a pianist, vocalist and keyboardist. The collaboration has been extended to the christmas services in 2022. I thank all the worship team members in providing serving opportunities and relevant worship trainings.

## Press Play - Get In The Mix
The "Press Play - Get In The Mix" was a summer children programme hosted by the [Fort Bend Community Church (FBCC)](https://www.fbcchome.org/FBCC/Page/9) from 1st August to 4th August. CCiL has been priviledged to be one of the co-host of the programme, and together with Vera Shek we were honoured to offer technical supports to the programme. Together we have served around 15 children, some of which had just arrived London, and we had promoted the idea of salvation (i.e. we are loved by God and that He died to save us from sin) through various creative activities. The church had also offered several talks to the parents about how to get along with the new UK communities as a supplement to our main programme. It is a wonderful experience for us to take care of children, as well as to know more about how Hong Kong families were adapting to new lives in the UK. I am glad that most participants found this programme enjoyable.

## Directed reading
I have also completed a directed reading on the book of "Basic Christianity", written by John Stott which addressed basic questions about salvation and how to live a christian lives. It was a great opportunity for me to reflect on our faith, as well as to explain difficult concepts in faith to new belivers.

# Imperial College Christian Union
As explained in the 2022 masterplan, I had gradually retired from serving in the Imperial College Christian Union. I am thankful for opportunities to serve as a musician during the Weekend Away and an assistant in coordinating impact group in mathematics. It has also been my honour to serve in the Christmas Carols, as a musician in 2021/22 and as a publication officer in 2021 (in collaboration with Michelle Wong). Arrangments to two carols (The First Noel, God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen) has been commissioned for the 2021 Christmas carol in collaboration with Joseph Ho.

# Adapting in Oxford

## Thesis @ St. Ebbes
It is my pleasure to join the Thesis, the postgraduate fellowship (Bible study group) at the St. Ebbes Church Oxford. We have been going through 1 Peter to explore how to live out a Christian life. In addition, I have joined their Weekend Away, in which we have explored how to prepare ourselves to evangelise in the current complex environment. It is a special experience for me to engage with a local Anglican (i.e. not Cantonese-speaking) church, and their teachings had provided a fresh perspective to my faith. I enjoyed the time in St. Ebbes so far, and I look forward to building deeper relationships with the members in the Thesis.

## University College Chapel
To fulfill the need of morning devotion, I have attended the traditional morning prayers offered at the chapel of my college (i.e. University College). Led by our chaplain (Dr. Andrew Gregory), we went through standard liturgies and some chapters in the Bible (Gospel of Matthew and the Acts of Apostles). They have been my encouragements from time to time.

I am also delighted to read in a couple of evensongs, and I hope to engage in musical activities in the chapel.

## Oxford Cantonese Fellowship
Finally, it is my pleasure to join a few socials in the Oxford Cantonese Fellowship. I thank for their preparations, and I look forward to joining more activities subject to the academic schedules (i.e. whether I have to be in London during weekends).
