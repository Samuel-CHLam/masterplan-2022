TL,DR:
- Successful launch of Imperial Wiki Project, require more contributions from members of Imperial College.
- Teaching assistantship in Oxford on Deep Learning
- Written an article for Logos Academy

# Imperial MathsWiki Project
My personal highlight on academic outreach would have been (co-)founding Imperial College MathsWiki (MathsWiki) with the collaboration from Imperial Wiki Project (WikiSoc, previously Imperial College ChemWiki), as a spin-off from the society webpage upgrade project for the Imperial College Mathematics Society (MathSoc). Launched on the 29th December, 2021, the MathsWiki is a centralised repository that contains summaries for various mathematics modules offered at Imperial College, as well as related official and unofficial resources.

The Imperial MathsWiki student developer team has welcomed three new adminstrators, Thomas Walker, Jaehyun Kim and Joseph Ho, as well as a couple of student developers and contributors. Together we have made very good progress in creating summaries for most of the year 1/2 modules, and collecting notes for some of the other year 3/4/postgraduate modules (the *upper-year* modules).

We would like to thank MathSoc in providing funding for the development of this project, as well as department for expressing their supports through the Student-Staff committee. We also thank the administrators from the Imperial Wiki Project (Thomas Cheng, Luc Paoli and David) and developers from other subject Wiki in providing technical supports and advice the development of MathsWiki.

## Content development

### Year 1/2 modules
Summaries are available for most of the year 1/2 modules. However, these notes require much polishing as they only contains summaries without further motivations and examples. As a result, the notes available are not as useful, especially for modules that require much computations (e.g. calculus with applications, or probability and statistics). We are now working on improving the existing year 1/2 notes by including examples, and perhaps visualisations (from ImpVis projects) and coding examples.

### Upper-year modules
Creating summaries for upper-year modules are much harder, mainly due to the vast number of options available and lack of contributors. In general, the MathsWiki need many more contributors to sustain its development.
- *Pure modules:* We have been extremely priviledged to have numerous contributors in providing their notes for pure modules. These includes David (2019 graduate in MEng Maths and Computing) who had provided notes in algebra and geometry, as well as KeXing Ying (2022 graduate in BSc in Mathematics) who had provided notes in analysis and probability theory.
- *Applied modules:* There are good notes provided for most of the applied modules, making less incentives for creating summaries for the MathsWiki. In particular, lecturers refrain from providing official notes as they see this as "giving out answers", and it is extremely important for students to go through the tedious derivations themselves without looking at solutions. MathsWiki would therefore have to think about what kind of resources would help users in the most effective way.
- *Undergraduate statistics modules:* Again there are extremely good notes provided for most of the statistics modules, making less incentives for creating summaries for the MathsWiki. Nevertheless, MathsWiki could potentially working on providing much condensed summaries and code demonstrations.

## Reception
- Promotion has been made primarily through welcome week booth, lecture advertisements and the welcoming message from the MathSoc president in the departmental welcoming booklet. As a result, many more students are aware of the existence of the MathsWiki project.
- However, there are not too many users who would actually use MathsWiki for revision. A potential reason (according to comments from some year 1 students) is that the summary pages have too much overlaps with the current existing official notes, that are already provided in accordance to the departmental Covid guidance. MathWiki is therefore working on improving the quality of summaries.
- Data analytics showed that users usually only visit the module homepages, without looking further into the summaries. A potential reason is that the summaries were only written very recently, so the users might not be aware of their existence.

## Collaboration with other Wiki
- The governing Wiki project has launched the LaTeX workshop as their debut event, which has received very positive feedbacks!
- Cross-deoartmental social has been held in mid-December, which is attended by leaders from all subject wikis. There are many constructive discussions on how the Wiki project would progress. We have agreed to provide weekly progress updates on a regular basis.
- Further activities has been planned for the spring term, include UROP talks and tutorials on GitHub.

## Personal Projects
I have been delighted on working the following personal projects on Imperial MathsWiki.
- Notes on Probability Theory (with Ivan Kirev) - we have been completing most of the chapters with the exception on the chapter on martingales. The completed notes would require further checks.
- Optimisation - this is a trial project with the lecturer in providing summaries to the content. Most of the summaries are completed with the exception on the topic of dynamic programming. I am also planning to include further coding demonstration on (stochastic) gradient descent.
- Multivariate Statistical Analysis - summaries have been written based on the notes by previous lecturer. We have rewritten the section on matrix derivatives to make the chapter more intuitive to users. The summaries are 1/3 done, and further contents will be created on classical hypothesis tests, principle component analysis (PCA) and discriminant analysis.
- Statistical Modelling I - summaries for most of the core topics are now completed. The next steps would be to create practical case studies, as well as summaries for other advanced topics (e.g. model selection, shrinkage and ANOVA). We are currently recruiting contributors for creating such contents.
- Differential Equations - summaries are now completed. The next steps would be to create examples (e.g. SIR models), as well as a summary for the proof of the Poincare-Benedixon theorem and Dulac criterion for the non-existence of the periodic orbits.
- Methods of Data Science - to begin. This module is one of the most popular modules. Creating summaries for this module would be extremely difficult as it involves so many topics. We have currently created a page that redirect users to some of the related pages made for the other modules (e.g. optimisation). The first step of the development would be to create a short guide for using Google Colaboratory (the Google Colab), good strategies in speeding up Python code (by e.g. avoiding for-loop by vectorisation) and some summaries for simple topics (e.g. naive Bayes estimator).

#Â Teaching in Oxford
I will take up duty as a teaching assistant for deep learning. This would involving marking students' problem sheets, providing supports to the tutorial classes, and writing questions to some of the problems.

## Logos Academy
It has been my pleasure to complete my primary and secondary education at the HKCCCU Logos Academy, and I am delighted to make contributions to their outreach.

- I had written an article for my high school mathematics magazine on the topic of linear regression, which has received positive comments. I may therefore work on further articles in the future.
- I am planning a visit to the Logos Academy in early January.
