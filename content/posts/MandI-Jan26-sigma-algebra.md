# Summary 
- We have done previous exercise on semi-norm.
- Facts about $\sigma$-algebra
    - Uncountable intersection of $\sigma$-algebra is also a $\sigma$-algebra. That is why it makes sense to talk about "the smallest $\sigma$-algebra" containing certain subset of power set. 
    - To prove $\sigma(C) \subseteq \mathcal{F}$ you show that $C$ is contained in $\mathcal{F}$.

# Exercise
1. Make sure you have read the proof of Carathedory extension theorem and the notions of null set. You can preview the proofs by looking at chapter 3 of my [notes](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qkxqjbnkmxxj).
2. Read through the chapter 2 of this [notes](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qkxqjbnkmxxj) if you want further exercises on collection of subsets.
3. If you want further exercises, see [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/sddqckxsrxtf)
