It is with great regret to inform you that I have been tested positive for COVID-19. For logistics purpose, I have created this post to list out key testing results and key contacts for your references. Some information has been redacted for privacy purposes.

# Key Testing Results
- Negative LFD result on 21/3 (Monday) afternoon.
- Mild symptom (coughing) developed on 22/3 (Tuesday) evening. A LFD test was done later that night and had negative result.
- I had done two LFDs on 23/3 (Wednesday) using two separate batches. Both results were positive.
- I had done a further PCR test on 23/3 (Wednesday), awaiting for result.

Based on the information above, 
- any contacts before 21/3 (Monday) should be regarded as low risk, and any contacts on or after 21/3 (Monday) should be regarded as high risk.

# Iternary
Further information will be released here. Any relevant contacts will be contacted separately.

# Recommendations
- For contacts who are regarded as "high risk", please get a LFD/PCR test regularly. You are not recommended to use the college testing scheme unless deemed necessary. These include those who have been infected by Covid before (researches indicate that you can be re-infected.)
- Please do not disclose any further information. This is for privacy concerns.
