introduction (10 minutes): warm-up, key questions the debate of circumcision (5+15 minutes): carefully scrutinise the debates in the Jerusalem council tips of handling conflicts (20 minutes): study again the passage and look at how the churches and leaders deal with conflicts applications (20 minutes) wrapping up (10 minutes) Introduction Warm-up question: Do you think churches would compromise in debates regarding theological matters?</description>

      <description>The following contents are taken from a discussion with my mother on 6/1/2022 (Thursday).
