      <description>Jonah Day 1: Jonah 1:1-13 Jesus asked Jonah to preach against the great city of Nineveh, but Jonah ran away and boarded a ship at Tarshish.
The wickedness of Nineveh scared Jonah away. Interesting that Jonah asked the sailors to throw him into the sea. Do you think Jonah is a good servant of God? </description>

      <description>We will be reading Matthew 19:16-30, the story of a rich man. If you have time, you may wish to continue reading the parable of the workers in the vineyard in Matthew 20:16, but this will only be covered briefly.
Questions By only just verse 26, can you infer what the verse is about? In verse 17 Jesus said &amp;ldquo;there is only One who is good&amp;rdquo;. Who was the One? Was it the rich man?</description>

      <description>It is with great regret to inform you that I have been tested positive for COVID-19. For logistics purpose, I have created this post to list out key testing results and key contacts for your references. Some information has been redacted for privacy purposes.
Key Testing Results Negative LFD result on 21/3 (Monday) afternoon. Mild symptom (coughing) developed on 22/3 (Tuesday) evening. A LFD test was done later that night and had negative result.</description>

      <title>MandI Jan26 Sigma Algebra</title>

      <description>Summary We have done previous exercise on semi-norm. Facts about $\sigma$-algebra Uncountable intersection of $\sigma$-algebra is also a $\sigma$-algebra. That is why it makes sense to talk about &amp;ldquo;the smallest $\sigma$-algebra&amp;rdquo; containing certain subset of power set. To prove $\sigma(C) \subseteq \mathcal{F}$ you show that $C$ is contained in $\mathcal{F}$. Exercise Make sure you have read the proof of Carathedory extension theorem and the notions of null set. You can preview the proofs by looking at chapter 3 of my notes.</description>

      <description>Follow up of lectures Formalisation of Riemann (Darboux) Integral: the upper and lower Darboux sum is defined as $$U(f) = \inf_\mathcal{P} U(f,\mathcal{P}), \quad L(f) = \sup_\mathcal{P} L(f,\mathcal{P})$$ where
$$U(f,\mathcal{P} = (x_i)_{i=0}^n) = \sum _{i=0}^{n-1} \left( \sup _{x \in [x_i, x _{i+1})} f(x) \right) (x _{i+1} - x_i)$$
$$L(f,\mathcal{P} = (x_i)_{i=0}^n) = \sum _{i=0}^{n-1} \left( \inf _{x \in [x_i, x _{i+1})} f(x) \right) (x _{i+1} - x_i)$$
