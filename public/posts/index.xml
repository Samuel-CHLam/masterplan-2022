      <description>Follow up of lectures  Formalisation of Riemann (Darboux) Integral: the upper and lower Darboux sum is defined as  $$U(f) = \inf_\mathcal{P} U(f,\mathcal{P}), \quad L(f) = \sup_\mathcal{P} L(f,\mathcal{P})$$ where
$$U(f,\mathcal{P} = (x_i)_{i=0}^n) = \sum _{i=0}^{n-1} \left( \sup _{x \in [x_i, x _{i+1})} f(x) \right) (x _{i+1} - x_i)$$
$$L(f,\mathcal{P} = (x_i)_{i=0}^n) = \sum _{i=0}^{n-1} \left( \inf _{x \in [x_i, x _{i+1})} f(x) \right) (x _{i+1} - x_i)$$

      <description>Quick notes from a discussion with CYF friends during the fellowship on 16/1/2021. I have just finished my Dynamics of Games homework and have been exhausted, so I decided to listen and I enjoy that so much. I am also glad that Yanni share my website to others.
 Jocelyn: Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about deadair. (Although &amp;ldquo;introverts are happy if extroverts take over&amp;rdquo;.) Joseph: Go beyond being silent and try to respond to others sharing.</description>

      <description>The following contents are taken from a discussion with my mother on 6/1/2022 (Thursday).
Basic Principles  Reflect on the expected achievements of plans everyday as a way to keep us going Start brainstorming with big direction, then set up easy (small) targets following the direction. It is easy to get lost: think about the example of Peter walking on the sea, and how Jesus responded when Peter hesitated. (Matthew 14:22-33, Bible) Successful planning involves lots of research and discussions Mind your language Be flexible, &amp;ldquo;be water my friend&amp;rdquo; (Bruce Lee)  Basic elements of a plan  knowledge skill habit (usually 21 days or 49 days) attitude  How to seek advice?</description>
