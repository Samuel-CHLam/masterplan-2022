      <description>Today we will go over Acts 15, verses 1-35. This passage is about the council at Jerusalem debating issue regarding circumcision. A quick plan would be
 introduction (10 minutes): warm-up, key questions the debate of circumcision (5+15 minutes): carefully scrutinise the debates in the Jerusalem council tips of handling conflicts (20 minutes): study again the passage and look at how the churches and leaders deal with conflicts applications (20 minutes) wrapping up (10 minutes)  Introduction  Warm-up question: Do you think churches would compromise in debates regarding theological matters?</description>

      <description>Some summary and notes from the book Basic Christianity by John Stott.
Chapter 1: The Right Approach God has taken initiatives to reveal Himself through creation, revelation (啟示) and salvation.
God demonstrating Himself  God has spoken  Natural revelation: demonstrated to everyone through his creation. Special revelation: demonstrated by a group of the &amp;ldquo;special messengers&amp;rdquo; to the &amp;ldquo;special people&amp;rdquo;.

      <description>Programme Planning  We have members with various experience in faith, so it is difficult to cater all needs. Rest assured that there are many &amp;ldquo;more experienced&amp;rdquo; members that could possibly help the &amp;ldquo;less experienced&amp;rdquo; people, but we also have to take care of others as well. Consideration of supporting study groups. Previous years we have  New: Interviews and Elections Interview  Faith criteria (have to be christians (重新得救的基督徒)).

      <description>This is my little sharing my experience as a vice chair in CYF. There are a few notes before we start:
 This is a personal sharing, so views towards issues may be heavily biased. I am always open to further discussions in these matters. There are actually two vice-chairs, since Vera has been appointed to share some of my duties, including the member and committee interviews. This sharing is supplemented with reference materials, which are included in this website.</description>

      <description>We will be reading Matthew 19:16-30, the story of a rich man. If you have time, you may wish to continue reading the parable of the workers in the vineyard in Matthew 20:16, but this will only be covered briefly.
Questions  By only just verse 26, can you infer what the verse is about? In verse 17 Jesus said &amp;ldquo;there is only One who is good&amp;rdquo;. Who was the One?</description>
