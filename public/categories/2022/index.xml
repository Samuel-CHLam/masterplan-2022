      <description>TL,DR:
Successful launch of Imperial Wiki Project, require more contributions from members of Imperial College. Teaching assistantship in Oxford on Deep Learning Written an article for Logos Academy Imperial MathsWiki Project My personal highlight on academic outreach would have been (co-)founding Imperial College MathsWiki (MathsWiki) with the collaboration from Imperial Wiki Project (WikiSoc, previously Imperial College ChemWiki), as a spin-off from the society webpage upgrade project for the Imperial College Mathematics Society (MathSoc).</description>

      <description>TL,DR:
Research project at Imperial on equivalence of non-parametric statistical experiments. Coursework at Imperial on functional analysis, optimisation, asymptotic methods, dynamics of games and mathematical biology. Research project at CDT Mathematics of Random Systems on theories of deep learning The final year at Imperial Research Project The major highlight of the year would be the completion of my final year dissertation with Prof. Alastair Young. The dissertation focuses on the equivalence of three non-parametric statistical experiments, including kernel density estimation, regression on Gaussian white noise and regression on Gaussian sequence.</description>
