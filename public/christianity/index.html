However due to workload I will be gradually reducing my engagement in ICCU.\nCantonese Youth Fellowship As the vice-president of the CYF committee, I am responsible for facilitating President work and coordinating among other committees and participants. During the first term, I organised the freshers’ events and provided pastoral supports to the participants.\nCommittee Justin (President): Design programme, liaise with advisors for programmes and administrative issues, coordinate Sunday bible study and badminton. Vera (Vice-President de-facto, worship and music): give advice to programmes, design P\u0026P, assign worship duties to members. Samuel (Vice-President): give advice to programmes, outreach to participants, administratives, early preparations for BMT. Cherry (pastoral): early bible studies with committee members, keep track of status of committees. Assign sharing duties. Thomas (secretary): Emails, administrative Chung (evangelism and outreach): assigning game duties, coordinate Sunday EBS. Amy, Prudence, Yanni (group leaders*): keep track of status of committees, lead discussions. Report Things to appreciate Despite the initial conflict in the committee, the preparation of programmes was generally well done. The Freshers’ Camp (FC) was well-received, and participants generally felt welcomed. Committee is finishing planning of all events. Appreciate how committees explain about the decisions during the planning process. Glad to see other experienced non-committee members are getting involved in different parts of CYF operations. Things to improve The initial conflict weakened my bondings with other committee members, and as a result, I was not focusing on my duty. (Relationship with committee members are generally improved.) I dominated in too many discussions in committee and groups: effective listening is needed. There are too many seniors in the committee - events like Praise and Prayer were planned in a rush due to huge academic workload. We should get more people involved. How can we get more people involved and ensuring them have good spiritual lives? Working principles Communication: Be aware if I have spoken too much in regular meetings: always end with “what do you think?” ask questions that are generally accessible to others; actively listen to other feedback and wait till they finish to respond; ask people if I have spoken too much; do not worry about dead air - other people will take care of it. Go beyond being silent and try to respond to others sharing. They need your encouragement. Enjoy the discussion with an aim to complete the main objective of discussion. Don’t force, we can always find another time to do. Bonding with committee members: Give thanks to the current good relationships. In particular, appreciate how committees respond and explain decisions. Continue pray that the good relationship can be maintained. start with something simple, e.g. chat, meal, or exercise together; do not worry if I am “not close enough” with committee members: the less worried I am, the better our relationship I could have. Bonding with general members: PRAY; try to prioritise quality than quantity in terms of building relationships with members; ACTION DONE: divide among group leaders, committee members and experienced members in providing pastoral and spiritual supports for group members. Regular review of members status during regular meetings. ACTION: Set up a spreadsheet detailing who need further attention. Remember it is appropriate to listen without getting involved in an unfamiliar discussion. Preparation of programmes: consult Justin before committee meetings if I have any ideas – in fact, I should do this with other committee members as well; listen to committees, including their suggestions and feedback. BMT Invite involvement of senior members. Setup trello to track progresses. Serving in CYF I should gradually retire from my role as a CYF musician to provide more training opportunities for others. regular review Vincent/Michael how to be a good mentor of musicians/potential committee members ACTION: ask musicians how they can be more involved in music (e.g. how should training be done?) encourage musicians to gain experience by more engagement. share about committee visions and my journey as a vice-president Sunday devotion :) be confident that Justin, Vera and Chung will provide more opportunities for members to serve as musicians/gamemasters; liaise with them; regular discuss with committees about serving positions. be attentive to others sharing their experience; encourage more involvement in larger gatherings (e.g. CNY, P\u0026P, BMT); consult other CU members for advice. Imperial College Christian Union ICCU I am gradually retring from ICCU, but would still regularly involve by prayers:\nRegularly involve in prayer breakfast and morning first contact Asking for prayer updates bi-weekly Post-hub run. ACTION: Liaise with James (Impact Group Leader) with arrangement of regular impact group meetings and departmental outreach programmes.
