      <description>Today we will go over Acts 15, verses 1-35. This passage is about the council at Jerusalem debating issue regarding circumcision. A quick plan would be
 introduction (10 minutes): warm-up, key questions the debate of circumcision (5+15 minutes): carefully scrutinise the debates in the Jerusalem council tips of handling conflicts (20 minutes): study again the passage and look at how the churches and leaders deal with conflicts applications (20 minutes) wrapping up (10 minutes)  Introduction  Warm-up question: Do you think churches would compromise in debates regarding theological matters?</description>

      <description>Some summary and notes from the book Basic Christianity by John Stott.
Chapter 1: The Right Approach God has taken initiatives to reveal Himself through creation, revelation (啟示) and salvation.
God demonstrating Himself  God has spoken  Natural revelation: demonstrated to everyone through his creation. Special revelation: demonstrated by a group of the &amp;ldquo;special messengers&amp;rdquo; to the &amp;ldquo;special people&amp;rdquo;. We are fortunate to acknowledge this revelation through evangelism.   God has acted because observation is what we need (due to our sinful and skeptical nature.</description>

      <description>This is my little sharing my experience as a vice chair in CYF. There are a few notes before we start:
 This is a personal sharing, so views towards issues may be heavily biased. I am always open to further discussions in these matters. There are actually two vice-chairs, since Vera has been appointed to share some of my duties, including the member and committee interviews. This sharing is supplemented with reference materials, which are included in this website.</description>

      <description>Quick notes from a discussion with CYF friends during the fellowship on 16/1/2021. I have just finished my Dynamics of Games homework and have been exhausted, so I decided to listen and I enjoy that so much. I am also glad that Yanni share my website to others.
 Jocelyn: Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about deadair. (Although &amp;ldquo;introverts are happy if extroverts take over&amp;rdquo;.) Joseph: Go beyond being silent and try to respond to others sharing.</description>

      <description>The following contents are taken from a discussion with my mother on 6/1/2022 (Thursday).
Basic Principles  Reflect on the expected achievements of plans everyday as a way to keep us going Start brainstorming with big direction, then set up easy (small) targets following the direction. It is easy to get lost: think about the example of Peter walking on the sea, and how Jesus responded when Peter hesitated. (Matthew 14:22-33, Bible) Successful planning involves lots of research and discussions Mind your language Be flexible, &amp;ldquo;be water my friend&amp;rdquo; (Bruce Lee)  Basic elements of a plan  knowledge skill habit (usually 21 days or 49 days) attitude  How to seek advice?</description>
