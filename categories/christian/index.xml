      <description>TL;DR: My reflection for my service as vice-chair of the committee of CYF during the first half of 2022.
I would like to firstly thank all communities who have been continuously praying for my continuous development as a christian. I am extremely delighted for my prayer made during my baptism in 2018 has been heard - that I have continuously grow in my faith.
Serving in the Cantonese Youth Fellowship Cantonese Youth Fellowship (CYF) is a fellowship in the Chinese Churches in London (CCiL), and has been nurturing many leaders that would later serve CCiL.</description>

      <description>Jonah Day 1: Jonah 1:1-13 Jesus asked Jonah to preach against the great city of Nineveh, but Jonah ran away and boarded a ship at Tarshish.
The wickedness of Nineveh scared Jonah away. Interesting that Jonah asked the sailors to throw him into the sea. Do you think Jonah is a good servant of God? </description>

      <description>Today we will go over Acts 15, verses 1-35. This passage is about the council at Jerusalem debating issue regarding circumcision. A quick plan would be
introduction (10 minutes): warm-up, key questions the debate of circumcision (5+15 minutes): carefully scrutinise the debates in the Jerusalem council tips of handling conflicts (20 minutes): study again the passage and look at how the churches and leaders deal with conflicts applications (20 minutes) wrapping up (10 minutes) Introduction Warm-up question: Do you think churches would compromise in debates regarding theological matters?</description>

      <description>Some summary and notes from the book Basic Christianity by John Stott.
Chapter 1: The Right Approach God has taken initiatives to reveal Himself through creation, revelation (啟示) and salvation.
God demonstrating Himself God has spoken Natural revelation: demonstrated to everyone through his creation. Special revelation: demonstrated by a group of the &amp;ldquo;special messengers&amp;rdquo; to the &amp;ldquo;special people&amp;rdquo;. We are fortunate to acknowledge this revelation through evangelism. God has acted because observation is what we need (due to our sinful and skeptical nature.</description>

      <description>We will be reading Matthew 19:16-30, the story of a rich man. If you have time, you may wish to continue reading the parable of the workers in the vineyard in Matthew 20:16, but this will only be covered briefly.
Questions By only just verse 26, can you infer what the verse is about? In verse 17 Jesus said &amp;ldquo;there is only One who is good&amp;rdquo;. Who was the One? Was it the rich man?</description>
