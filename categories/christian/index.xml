      <description>Today we will go over Acts 15, verses 1-35. This passage is about the council at Jerusalem debating issue regarding circumcision. A quick plan would be
introduction (10 minutes): warm-up, key questions the debate of circumcision (5+15 minutes): carefully scrutinise the debates in the Jerusalem council tips of handling conflicts (20 minutes): study again the passage and look at how the churches and leaders deal with conflicts applications (20 minutes) wrapping up (10 minutes) Introduction Warm-up question: Do you think churches would compromise in debates regarding theological matters?</description>

      <description>We will be reading Matthew 19:16-30, the story of a rich man. If you have time, you may wish to continue reading the parable of the workers in the vineyard in Matthew 20:16, but this will only be covered briefly.
Questions By only just verse 26, can you infer what the verse is about? In verse 17 Jesus said &amp;ldquo;there is only One who is good&amp;rdquo;. Who was the One? Was it the rich man?</description>
